This translation was prepared by Gillian Gallagher with the
assistance of Gladys Camacho Rios, the author and a native speaker of Quechua
from Cochabamba, Bolivia. The translation is meant to be helpful to students of
Quechua. To this end, the English translation has been interspersed with the
original Quechua, paragraph-by-paragraph. Additionally, every effort was made
to remain as close as possible to the original Quechua in the structure of the
translation. In many cases, this meant sacrificing some naturalness and flow in
the English. In other cases, substantial modification from Quechua to English
were unavoidable. Errors, questions or suggestions are welcome and should be
directed to Gillian Gallagher at  ggillian@nyu.edu . The novela was
completed in May 2013 and published in Bolivia by Kipus. The translation was
completed in September 2014, and was partially supported by funds from the
Center of Latin American and Carribean Studies at New York University.

In our country of Bolivia there are all kinds of people, cultures, languages and ways
of living. Our dear sister Gladys Camacho
reminds us and tells us a little about this diversity. In the region of
Cochabamba live Quechua people and Quechua speakers, and in this book she tells
us, little-by-little, what Quechua life is like and how it all seems.


Regarding the work “The bloody tear of a
cloud”, it is written and prepared for all Quechua speakers. Like this, little
by little, day by day, we will read better in Quechua. All of us in the city of
Cochabamaba really want to read a book in Quechua, and because of this this
book was prepared as it is.

Kay jawariyqa Faustinup kawsayninmanta wawa

The story of Faustino’s life from when he was
a little boy up until he was an old man, how he grew from a small boy in the
town Kalallusta, got married, and
then went to Cochabamba to work, and even though he worked, he didn’t keep his
money, the story of him going through this sadness crystalizes from Chapter 1
to Chapter 7, we are made to read the book as an extended memory. This is why I
can say this is a great story.

Ñawpaqtaqa Faustinuqa Fransisku, Inkarna tatan

In the beginning, Faustino is small and lives
with his mother Inkarna and father Fransisco, then when he is a young man he
marries Francisca. For the wedding,
they get married with just the woman’s family in Muruq’u Urqu, not many of
Faustino’s family were there, that day people don’t speak well about the life
of this bride and groom. And just like they said, year by year it isn’t good
for them. Faustino goes with a gun to
fight together with his fellow townspeople, and then he comes back; then he
goes to the big city of Cochabamba, where he enters the life of drinking
chicha, and spends all his money on nothing.

Our sister Gladys
Camacho’s story is almost perfect; it is like many people’s lives, because
of this her book makes us think hard, reflect and remember the past and helps
us to see a better way to live. Thank you, thank you Gladys for writing this story here.

-“ ¡ Jamuy Fransisku!” – ñispa sinchimanta qhaparimusqa.

“Come on in, Francisco!” he said, calling out
loudly.

runataq kaq kasqa.

In the little community of Kalallusta, Tata
Francisco was a well respected person. He had a lot of money. He also had a lot
of land, and grew everything very well. “He talks to the devil”, all the
townspeople said. He was a very mean man.

Tata Philipiqa juk tullu runalla,
Kalallusta ayllupi ñan patapi aqha wasiyuq karqa.

mana tatanta saqiyta munaspa qhipanta, llamt’a q’ipirisqa pacha,
yaykuykullasqataq.

Tata Phillip was a skinny little guy, with a
chichería on the main road in the town of Kalallusta. Since his wife died, he
had been making chicha on his own and selling it to everyone in town. That day,
Tata Phillip went up to Tata Francisco, grabbed him by the hand and pulled him
into his house. Faustino, not wanting to leave his father, also went in after
him, carrying his load of wood.

-“¡Tatay ama aqhata
upyankichu! ¡tutayawasunman ripunallaña tatay!” - ñispa, Faustinuqa tatanman
parlasqa.

“Papa, don’t drink chicha! Let’s go before it
gets dark on us, Papa.” Faustino said to his father.

-“¡Karaju! ¡Mana kaypi
wawakuna aqhata upyankuchu! Qamqa ¡utqhayta wasiman ripuy! ¡chay llamt’ata
mamayki wayk’unanpaq, utqhayta apay!” - ñispa tata Fransiskuqa wawanta
ch’inyarparichisqa.

“Damnit! Children don’t drink chicha here!
You, go home right away! That wood is for your mother to cook with, take it to
her quickly!” said Tata Francisco, silencing his child instantly.

-“Arí Faustinitu,
ripullayña, ¿yachu? Ñuqaykuqa tataykiwan juk juch’uy p’uyñu aqhitataraq
upyarqusqayku, chanta tataykiqa jampullanqa”- kumpa Philipiqa ñisqa.

“Yes, Faustino, go on, ok? We’ll just drink a
small jug of chicha, your father and me, and then he’ll head back.” Kumpa
Phillip said.

Wawaqa ch’insitumanta
llamt’a q’ipirisqa pacha lluqsimuytawan wasinman kachaykakapusqa. Tata Philipip
wasinmanta Faustinup wasinman chayamunapaqqa karutaraq thatkimuna kasqa, P’uqru Pata[2]

Sapitan Faustinuqa

qallarisqa pacha. Wawaqa patata qhawarisqa, yana phuyukuna junt’ita
urmaykurimuchkankumanpis jina tukuy chiruman kuyuykacharisqanku.

Faustino was heading back alone, and when he
had already walked very far, all of a sudden, rain started to drip down. The
child looked up, the full black clouds moved back and forth, looking as though
they were were about to fall down.

-“¡Lliphiq! ¡Lliphiq! ¡Qhururun!
¡Qhururun!” - patapiqa sinchita uyaririkusqa.

He suddenly heard the crash! boom! of thunder
from the sky, and saw the flash of lightning.

Astawan paraqa
sinchimanta jich’akuyta qallarisqa. Faustinutaq mancharisqa utqhayta
thatkillasqapuni. Ichapis payqa yachasqaña P’uqru
Pata mayuman sapa paraptin achkha yaku chayamunantaqa. Wasinman
chayapunanpaqtaq chay mayutaqa chimpananpuni kasqa. Mana chay mayupi chaka
tiyaqchu.

The rain started to pour down even harder.
Faustino kept walking quickly, afraid. He may have known that every time it
rained, a lot of water filled the P’uqru
Pata river. And to get home, he had to cross that river. There was no
bridge over the river.

Wawa urquta muyuykamusqataq,
mayuta qhawarimusqataq. Mayutaqa qunchu yaku junt’ita ririchkasqa. Chayta
rikuytawan uña yuqallituqa astawan mancharikusqa.

The child came around a mountain, and the
river came into view. Murky water was flowing rapidly, filling the river. The
young boy saw this and got very scared.

-“¿Imaynallata kunan
mayuta chay chhika yakuyuqta chimpasaqri? Chay chhika yaku apaspa
wañuchiwanmanpischá”- ñisqa t’ukurisqa, chanta thatkillasqapuni.

“How will I cross the river with so much
water? With that much water, it could kill me.” He thought and then continued
walking.

Mayuman chayamusqataq,
parataq manapuni pisiyasqachu, astawan sinchita parayta qallarisqa. Faustinuqa
mayu kantupi llamt’a q’ipisituntin ima juk juch’uy sach’a uritapi paramanta
pakakuspa qhipakusqa.

He got to the river, but the rain was still
not weakening. It started to rain even harder. At the river bank, Faustino kept
himself and all the wood he was carrying covered from the rain under a small
tree.

Mayumanqa yakuqa
yapakamullasqapuni, sinchita mancharikunapaqjinapuni. “¡Luqhuqun! ¡Luqhuqun!”
ñispa rumikunataqa yakuqa uraman, uraman chinkaykuchisqa. Chay chhika yakuqa
mayu kantupi sach’akunatapis t’iraytawan chinkaykuchillasqataq.

Water kept adding itself to the river, making
him so terribly afraid. “Gulp, gulp” and the rocks disappeared deep under the
water. All this water uprooted the trees at the bank of the river, and made
them disappear too.

Para tumpata
ch’inyaptinqa, chiriñataq qallarisqa, Faustinup p’achanqa ch’aritan, yakulla
sut’urichkasqa. Chiriqa juq’u p’achayuqtaqa kharkatichiyta qallarichisqa,

-“jik’un jik’un”- ñispa, chayjina ch’in mayu kantupi phutiyta waqallasqapuni.

When the rain calmed a little, it began to get
cold. Faustino’s clothes were completely soaked, dripping water. He began to
tremble from the cold and his wet clothes, and the darkness scared him. Unable
to do anything, the child sat down on the bank of the river and cried sadly. It
was too far to turn back to his father, and the river was too full of water to
cross. Unable to do anything, there in the dark he kept crying sadly, not even
the moon shone down on him as it got darker. Looking out in front of him, he
saw a big black cliff; looking down, he saw the trees with their limbs
flailing, as if they were people sparring back and forth. He was even more
afraid – “hiccup, hiccup” – he said, at the silent river bank he cried and
cried, becoming very distressed.

Faustinup wasinpiqa mama
Inkarnaqa ch’isi mikhunata chayachiytawankamaqa, llakisqa phichqa wawanwan ima
t’ukurisqa.

At Faustino’s house, right after she prepared
the evening meal, Mama Inkarna was thinking about her poor fifth child.

-“Yakuchá
tataykichiktawan Faustinuytawan jark’aykun. Ichapis taripamuq risunman”- ñisqa.

“Maybe the water stopped your father and
Faustino. Perhaps we should go find them.” She said.

-“Arí mamay jaku rinachik
kay ch’aki punchukunatawan apanachik q’alitutachá para juq’uykun”- kuraq
warmi-wawan Libirata sutiyuq kutichisqa.

“Yes Mama, let’s go. Let’s take dry ponchos,
the rain may have completely soaked them.” Libirata, the eldest daughter,
responded.

Mama Inkarnawan,
Libiratawan, Apoloniowan, Juliawan imaqa chakipi kachaykukusqanku. Chay
ch’isiqa michiru juqharisqa, ñanta k’ancharispa thatkisqanku. P’uqru Pata mayuman chayachkaptinkuña
Faustinuqa michiru k’anchata rikumuytawankamaqa phutiyta ñisqa:

Mama Inkarna, Libirata, Apolonio and Julia
headed off on foot. They took out the lantern that night, they walked along a
well-lit road. When they were getting to the P’uqru Pata river, Faustino saw the lantern glow and immediately
called out in distress.

-“¡Ayllu-masikuna, yaku
jark’aykuwan!”- sunqu nanayta, sinchita qhaparikamusqa.

“Neighbors! the water has blocked me!” he
cried out loudly, his heart aching.

-“¡Chay Faustinituysinaqa!” -
ñispa mama Inkarnaqa utqhayta purirpasqa.

“That sounds like my little Faustino!” Mama
Inkarna said, walking faster.

-“¿Imaptintaq sapitan
kachkanmanri?”- ñispa Juliataq mamanpaq qhipanta utqhayta purillasqataq.

“Why would he be alone?” said Julia, and
continued walking quickly after her mother.

Mayuman chayaptinku,
wawaqa sapitan mayu kantupi llamt’itantin llakiyta chukukuchkasqa.

When they got to the river, the child was
alone at the bank of the river, sitting sadly with all of his wood.
-“¡Mamay! tatay kumpa
Philipippi qhipakun, ñuqatataq wasiman ripuchkay ñispa sapitayta
kacharpampuwan”- ñispa Faustinuqa sinchimanta jik’un jik’un waqaririspa
mamanman willarikamusqa.

“Mama!
Papa stayed at Kumpa Phillip’s, and sent me off by myself to go home” Faustino
told his mother, choking loudly on his tears.

-“Ama waqaychu wawitay,
kunititan chimpamusqayku” -ñispa mamanqa llakisqa kutichisqa.

“Don’t cry my child, we will cross right now,”
his mother answered sadly.

Maman paymanta qayllapi
kasqanta yachaytawanqa Faustinuqa manaña manchachikusqañachu. Tawa
phanimantawanqa pisimanta pisi yaku pisiyasqa. Astawan yaku pisiyaptinqa,

yakuqa urmachiyta munasqa. Juliaqa punchukuna q’ipirisqa astawan sinchita
mamanmantawan turanmantawan jap’ikusqa, jinallapi mayutaqa chimpasqanku.

Once he knew his mother was close by, Faustino
wasn’t afraid anymore. Over four hours, the water level went down little by
little. When the water had gone down enough, his mother, Julia, Libirata and
Apolonio grabbed onto each other tightly and began to cross the river. The
water was up to their ankles, all the water almost made them fall. Carrying the
ponchos, Julia tightened her grip on her mother and brother, and like that they
all crossed the river.

-“¡Kay millana qhincha,
wawaytachu sapanta kachampuwan! ¿Maypi kunan tatayki kachkanri?”- mama
Inkarnaqa ñisqa.

“Oh that awful, wretched man, sending my child
back to me alone. Where is your father now?” Mama Inkarna said.
Faustinuqa mamanta uqllaykuytawan
sinchitapuni jik’un jik’unta waqallasqataq.

Faustino hugged his mother and kept sobbing
very loudly.

-“Tata Philipippi aqhata

jik’un jik’un mamanman willakusqa.

“He is drinking chicha at Tata Phillip’s.
While we were on our way back, Phillip just came out, and grabbed him by the
hand. Then he said to me “Go, take that wood to your mother quickly so she can
make dinner!”, and they just sent me off by myself,” Faustino said to his
mother, choking on his sobs.

Pananqa       utqhayta       ch’aki
 punchuta      q’ipinmanta
 jurqhuytawan         Faustinuta mayt’uykusqa.

His sister quickly took out a dry poncho from
her bundle and wrapped it around Faustino.

-“Tuta ch’isiyayta chay
aqha wiksaqa aqhata upyanqa, ¡jaku ripunachik!” -mama Inkarnaqa llamt’ata
q’ipiriykukuspa ñisqa.

“That drunkard will drink all night, let’s

Yakuqa astawan pisiyayta
qallarisqa. Kunanpiwanqa phichqankumanta astawan jasatañamin mayuta
chimpapusqanku. Michiruwan k’ancharikuspa, k’ancharikuspaqa wasinkuman

The water was beginning to lessen even more.
Then the five of them crossed the river more easily. With the lantern glowing
and glowing, they made it home.
Q’ayantin paqarinqa
laqhallaraq kachkaptin, k’anka jukta qhapariptin tata Fransiskuqa machasqa

The next morning when it was still dark, Tata
Francisco arrived at the house drunk, just as the rooster crowed for the first
time.

-“¡Inkarna! ¿Maytaq
mikhuna?”- ñispa, punkuta sinchita jayt’aspa kichariytawan yaykumusqa.

“Inkarna! where is the food?” he said. He came
in, throwing the door open.

-“¿Imaptintaq wawata
sapanta kachampurqankiri?” -ñispa mama Inkarnaqa payman phiñasqa chimpasqa.

“Why did you just send the boy back alone?”
Mama Inkarna said to him, going over to him angrily.

-“¡Manachu chakiyuq

Fransiskuqa astawan phiñarikusqa.

“Doesn’t he have feet?! He has feet, he can
get here. Bring me some food, quickly!” Fransisco said, very angry.

-“Jinallatapuni qamqa

“You always make us suffer like that! bastard!

patties and served them to him.

Chaypi tata Fransiskuqa
ila k’ispiñuta llaqwayuqta mikhuq churakusqa. Jinallapi Faustinuqa
jatarimusqa.

Tata Francisco started to eat the cold wheat
patties with hot sauce. Just then, Faustino got up.

-“Sumaq p’unchaw tatay, sumaq

“Good morning Papa, good morning Mama”

“I’m off!” he said calling from by the door.

ñisqa. Tatanqa machasqa ni uyarillasqapischu, mikhullasqapuni.

“Go on my boy, do what your teacher says, ok?”
His mother said. His drunk father didn’t even hear, he just kept on eating.

-“Ya mamay” - ñispa punkuta

“Yes mama!” he said, he opened the door and
left.

The young boy headed straight down the road.
He had to walk very far everday to get to school, it was about 7 kilometers
away. When he got to the P’uqru Pata river,
his friend Waltiku Pardo was already waiting for him with a ball.

-“¿Faustinu wach’inaykita

“Faustino do you have your arrow?” asked
Waltiku.

“Yeah

The two young boys headed off down the road to
school.

-“Qayna ch’isi P’uqru Pata mayupi yaku jark’aykuwarqa”- ñispa Faustinuqa Waltikuman
willarikusqa.

“Last night the water in P’uqru Pata river blocked me” Faustino told Waltiku.

-“Sinchita paraykurqa,

“It rained so much, there was even water
running down behind my house” Waltiku responded.
Jinata tukuy imamanta parlaspa,

They walked a long time like this until they
go to school, talking about everything and trying to kill birds with the arrow.

That day, the teacher taught addition to the
children. To learn to count, the children got beans and some little sticks,
small stones, wheat and corn. Faustino and Waltiku got red beans. The children
spent a long time playing like this, playing and learning. Everyday at noon,
when they went to eat their lunches, all the children sat in a circle and ate
what they had brought. When they finished eating, some of the kids went into
the river to play. Faustino and Waltiku went to the football field and played
with the other children.

The boys played ball so much at school,
everyday. Because of this, all the kids wanted to go to school. Everyone who
went to school had to learn addition, reading and writing. After learning these
things, they didn’t have to go to school anymore. They were put right to work
helping their parents. Faustino’s brothers and sisters didn’t go to school
anymore. They had to plant in the fields with his mother and father, digging
and cutting the wheat. They had to help with everything.

They grew so many potatoes every year, no one
else in the little town of Kalallusta
grew potatoes like that, they had always been the best farmers. And because of
this, everyone rushed to help dig up potatoes at harvest time.

Tata Francisco got up as soon as the rooster
crowed. He took out his coca bag and chewed a bit right away, then he went out.
He saw all the people and asked:

-“¿Qamkunachu papa

“You came to help with the potato harvest?” he
asked loudly, raising his head up.

-“Arí tata Fransisku,

“Yes tata Francisco, our supply of potatoes
has diminished very quickly, there isn’t anything to eat already. We come
because of this. We come to work hard and help out!” one person answered.

-“Jina kaptinqa

juknintaq ñisqa.

“That’s right, let’s get going right away. We
have to finish the harvest today!” someone else said.

-“¡Inkarna! ¿Maytaq chay

“Inkarna! Where are your lazy ass children,
have they gotten up yet? The helpers are already here, come on, let’s go
already!” He went angrily into the house while calling out loudly.

Then they all set off for the field in a
group. At the edge of the field, tata Francisco carefully divided up the
people, some would dig up the potatoes in one area, and others in another area.
After hearing their instructions, each worker began to dig right away. Every
potato plant was perfectly ripe, each root had 10, 13, 15 potatoes, and they
were all enormous. All the workers, happy and longing for such potatoes of
their own, kept on digging, smiling, talking and shouting back and forth.

Tata Francisco also started digging, just like
all the other workers. No one could dig like he could. As soon as he grabbed
the spade, he sent a dry shrub flying with one big thrust. After that, he
picked up the potatoes four by four and put them in a basket. After a filling a
basket, he put it on his head so that everyone could see, and closing his eyes
he dumped the basket out onto the big pile of potatoes. After seeing this, all
the workers applauded. He raised his head up. Francisco was the greatest man of
all. A black man. With an enormous beard. Every time he smiled his white teeth
appeared through his beard. He had big eyes, Francisco was an awful man.

-“¡Ajinata papataqa allana

4   Wiskana

[like a pickaxe]
“Now that’s how you harvest potatoes!” He
said, starting to dig potatoes again.

Many children followed after the harvesters,
sifting through the dirt for potatoes. Perhaps the potato harvesters hadn’t
collected every single potato, and they could dig them up themselves to carry
home.   Maximiliano, a boy from Muruq’u Urqu, still
quite young, had come to the potato harvest with his father to do just this.

-“¡Waway! Qamqa papitata
wasiman apakunanchikpaq chaqmakunki”- Maximilianop tatanqa ñisqa.

“My child! You dig up a few potatoes for us to
carry home.” Maximiliano’s father said.

-“Manchikuni tatay.
Ichapis Tata Fransiskutaraq tapuriwaq”- Maximilianoqa kutichisqa.

“I’m afraid father. Maybe you could ask tata
Francisco?” Maximilano replied.

-“Jaqay, jaqaypi wawan
kachkan. Yana liq’iyuq qamjina yuqallitu, payta tapurqamuy wawitay”- ñispa
tatanqa kachasqa.

“There’s his son right over there. That little
boy with a black hat like you, just go over and ask him my child.” his father
said, sending him off.

So Maximilano walked up to Faustinu and asked:

-“¿Kay sukapi papata

“Could I sift for potatoes in this row?”

-“Arí, ichapis

“Yes, maybe the two of us could race” said
Faustino, Francisco’s youngest child.

Then they dug up the potatoes from what the
harvesters had left behind, racing each other.

At midday, mama Inkarna and her two daughters
started to build five ovens for roasting potatoes in the ground. The older
child Libirata built a good oven. Julia, dripping sweat, quickly lit the fire
to heat up the oven. When the ovens were good and hot, they dumped in ten
enormous buckets of potatoes. After covering them very well with dirt, they
turned back into the house to grind the hot sauce.

In their house, they ground many ulupika peppers into a sauce, it was
maybe enough to fill ten little bowls, it was enough for all the workers. They
prepared it in one big clay bowl to carry to where the others were working.

Libirata carried chicha on her back in a big
jug, and took the big bowl of hot sauce in her hand. Mama Inkarna was already
big with child and as she tried to lift the heavy things she said:

-“Ususikunay, unquq

“My daughters, I don’t feel well, you’ll have
to take it on your own, I can’t lift something so heavy, my stomach is starting
to hurt, maybe I’m already going into labor”.

-“Arí mamay qamqa

“Yes mama, I‘ll carry the big dish” Julia

Then the three of them set out for the field
together. As soon as they arrived, they quickly dug up the potatoes, and then
put them into five huge baskets.

-“¡Apolonio!- Papa

“Apolonio! Sweep up so we can put the roasted

He broke off a big green branch from a t’ula tree, and swept clean a big area
with it. Then they dumped lots of roasted potatoes in a row. When they had
dumped them out, mama Inkarna picked out the biggest potatoes and put them in a
small basket. She would give these to tata Francisco with a bowl of hot sauce,
before anyone else ate.

As soon as they finished eating, the went back
to digging up potatoes until they were finished. At sunset, when tata Francisco
was giving out potatoes to the workers for their help, mama Inkarna’s stomach
started to hurt badly.

-“¡Paqarikunqaña,
Paqarikunqaña! Sinchitapuni wiksay nanachkawan”- ñispa pampaman
chukuykakapusqa.

“I’m giving birth, I’m giving birth!” My

“Quickly, let’s get her up on a donkey” mama
Isika, one of the potato harvesters, said. They led her back to her house like
this. When they arrived at the house, they laid her out on the bed to give
birth. Mama Isika was the woman who always helped with births. She would take
good care of mama Inkarna.

As the years passed, Elena grew, Faustino
became a tall man and he got stronger. Faustino and his brothers and sisters
worked very hard with their parents, he didn’t go to school anymore. Every year
tata Francisco and mama Inkarna grew a bountiful crop and then they took it to
Cliza to sell.

Tata Francisco always had a lot of money from
selling his produce. He was the meanest man in Kalallusta. The townspeople
really hated him, awful Francisco, because he beat mama Inkarna so hard, and
his children too. Because of this, every time tata Francisco went to kumpa
Phillip’s chicería to drink, mama Inkarna immediately took her children and
escaped to a rock hut a little ways beyond her house, in order to avoid
fighting with her husband when he came back. They next day she came back at
dawn. Mama Inkarna was a small woman. Olive-skinned. Thick black braids. White
hat. Black sandals. She always wore a green skirt.

There was just a single parrot in all of
Kalallusta, in tata Francisco’s house. His brother had brought this beautiful
green parrot from the Chapare and sold it to him for 16 Bolivianos. This parrot
knew how to speech Quechua well. As soon as it heard someone say something, it
wanted to talk to them. It was always on top of the peach tree talking about
something.

One Sunday Tata Francisco was in Linda Q’asa, flirting with his chola,
Katalina. Mama Inkarna was alone in the house, starting to bowl the water for
chicha in a big pot. Suddenly, the parrot started to talk:

-“Mama Inkarnita, Lisu Fransiskuqa

“Little Mama Inkarna, that jerk Francisco is
with his chola, little Mama Inkarna, Francisco is with his other chola” he
said.

Mama Inkarnaqa urituta

After hearing the parrot, Mama Inkarna thought
hard:

-“¿Imaptinpunitaq kay

parlanmanchu. Chay qhincha Fransiskuqa chulanwanpunichá karikuchkan”-.

“Why
does this parrot always say things like this to me? the parrot knows so much,
couldn’t it just talk nonsense? That shameful Francisco is probably always with
his chola.”

Ajinata t’ukurikuytawanqa,

After thinking this, she quickly went back to
lighting the fire to boil the water.

Yakuqa t’impuyta qallarisqa.

The water started to boil. And right then,
Tata Francisco arrived a little drunk.

-“¿Maymantataq

“Where are you coming from? and who were you
with?” Mama Inkarna said angrily.

-“Wirta Mayupi 11

“I visited the fields over in Wirta Mayu, I
dug a canal to bring the water up from the river to the field.” He said loudly.

-“Chay qhincha

“He says you were fooling around with your
disgraceful chola.” Mama Inkarna said even louder, angry.

-“¿Pitaq ñin?”- ñispa Fransiskuqa
phiñarikullasqataq.

“Who says” Francisco said, getting angry
himself.

-“Uritu niwan”- ñispataq
kutichisqa.

“The parrot told me” she replied.

When he heard this, the nasty Fransisco got
really mad. He picked up a rock, threw it at the parrot and knocked it out of
the tree. As soon as he had grabbed it, he said “Damn liar! Now you’ll learn
something” he said to the bird, after squeezing it

tightly with his hand he tossed it under the
pot in the middle of the fire.

-“¡Ama jinaychu!”- ñisqapis mama

“Don’t do that!” cried Mama Inkarna.

Nasty Francisco didn’t even hear her. He threw
the parrot in the fire alive, and he kept it under the pot with a stick,
burning it until it was dead. The parrot died in the fire, screaming in
distress.

The next day, Faustino and his siblings cried
so hard when they learned about the parrot. They were very angry with their
father. Tata Francisco beat his children whenever he felt like it. He was
always yelling something, “idiot! stupid! lazy donkey!”. He really hurt Mama
Inkarna and the children. Because of this, Mama Inkarna and her children
usually went places alone. Their father didn’t even go to festivals with them.
He disappeared to wherever on his own. No one knew, and no one asked.

-“¡Supaywan purin!, ¡Supaywan

In 1944, as the years went on Faustino became
a young man. He was a big man, with black hair, brown eyes, and a slightly
rough face. He had short pants, and always walked around in a brown poncho. He
knew how to play the carnival songs well on the accordion and the charango. He
knew both the songs and the dances. By then he was going to Anzaldo by himself.

Fridays were market day in Anzaldo. They sold
everything there. Every Friday, Faustino got up as soon as the rooster crowded.
He quickly took out fresh clothes, got dressed and combed his hair.

Faustino ñapis mikhuyta tukuchkaptinñaqa Waltiku masinqa yuthujina khuyurimusqa

One Friday morning, Mama Inkarna had made
boiled corn for breakfast for all her children. When Faustino had almost
finished eating, his friend Waltiku whistled out like a bird.

Waltikup khuyusqanta
uyariytawanqa:

After hearing Waltiku’s whistle:

-“Mamay, tatay! Anzaldo
qhatuman Waltikuwan richkani”- ñiytawan utqhayllata jawaman lluqsisqa.

“Mama, papa! I’m going to the Anzaldo market
with Waltiku” he said and quickly went out.

Waltiku was also a big young man. Black eyes.
He had a black mole on his face. With a square nose. He always had short pants
and went around with a black shawl. Faustino and Waltiku had been good friends
for a long time. They had always gone around to festivals together. And that
day too, the two of them were heading out to Anzaldo together. That Friday,
they walked for two hours, talking the whole time. These two talked about
everything; women, festivals, work, their parents.

Chayllapi Waltiku ajinata
parlasqa:

Suddenly, Waltiku said:

-“Wadalupita kay karnawal raymipi
suwakapunaypuni tiyan”-

“I really have to get win Guadalupe over at
the carnival this year”

-“Arí. Sumaq warmisina
kanman Wadalupiqa, awaytapis, phuchkaytapis, lawa wayk’uytapis yachan, ñispa
mamay parlachkarqa”- ñispataq Faustinuqa kutichisqa.

“Yea, I think she’s a good woman, my mom was
saying that she knows how to weave, spin yarn, and make soup.” Faustino
replied.

-“Ñuqapis juk k’acha
imillata qhawarquchkani karnawalpi suwarqukunaypaqqa”- ñillasqataq Faustinuqa.

“I also have a beautiful girl in mind for this
carnival” Faustino added.

-“Pitaq?”- ñispa Waltiku
tapurikusqa.

“Who?” Waltiku asked.

-“Muruq’u Urqumanta, Fransiska
sutin, Maximilianop panan”- ñisqa.

“She’s from Muruq’u Urqu, her name is
Francisca, she’s Maximiliano’s sister,” he said.

-“Pitaq chay Maximilianori?”-
T’ukuspa Waltiku tapullasqataq.

“And who’s this Maximiliano?” Waltiku asked,
thinking.

-“Luqt’u uma! Manachu

“Dummy! You don’t remember! Last Friday a guy
was drinking chicha with three girls at the “Sweet mouth” chichería. We were
sitting at a table behind the door. When I went to pee after drinking a lot,
then the big guy came over to me and offered me his hand to say hello,”
Faustino said.

-“Ahhh. Juk p’aqu liq’iyuq yuqalla
ih?”- ñispataq Waltikuqa tapurisqa.

“Ohhh, the guy with the brown shawl, right?”
Waltiku responded.

-“Paypuni ah! qayna wata

Faustinuqa.  [6] [6]

“Yes, him!” Last year at the Tata Santiago[7]
festival I saw him with a beautiful young woman, I went over to greet
Maximiliano. Then he bought an ice cream for the young woman. After that, when
I asked “who’s that” Maximiliano told me “my little sister”. If you could just
see her, his sister, a beautiful girl, small white face, crystal clear hazel
eyes, she’s a beautiful young woman” Faustino said.  [7] [7]

Jinata ch’aqwaspa

They got to Anzaldo quickly, talking like
this. As soon as they arrived in Anzaldo, they walked around looking at
everything.

He introduced Maximiliano and Waltiku, and
then all three of them walked all around looking at clothes and looking at
girls, annoying them and longing for them. They bought food and ate it, and all
three of the handsome young men drank chicha as well.

Chay p’unchawqa tumpata
machaykuytawanñaqa, Maximiliano ajinata ñisqa:

That day, after they were a little drunk,
Maximiliano said:

-“Karnawal raymipi
Muruq’u Urqu llaqtayman jamunkichikpuni, chaypi aqhata upyarikusunchik,
takisunchik tususunchik ima”-

“You guys should come to Carinival in Muruq’u
Urqu, we can sing and dance and drink chicha there.”

-“Jamusqayku, jamusqayku.

kutichisqanku.

“We’re coming, we’re coming. And if you come
to Kalallusta beforehand, we could gather some other people there and all
leave, singing and dancing.” Faustino and Waltiku answered.

-“Jina kachun! Ñuqa

“Great! I’ll strum the guitar, Faustino will
play the charangu, and Waltiku will play the accordian.” Maximiliano said
excitedly.

-“Ñuqa tataymanta

Waltikuqa yapaykusqa.

“I’ll borrow an accordian from my father and
play it really well, and the women will sing,” Waltiku added.

-“Arí masikuna,

“Yea, friends, this year we’ll dance really
well at the festival. Maximiliano, you could come with your sister” Faustino
added a little anxiously.

-“ajajajay, Sullk’a

“hahaha, You like my little sister? hahaha,
she’s still a little girl, my mother and father don’t let her go anywhere alone
yet, and she doesn’t know how how to cook well yet either” Maximiliano
responded.

Faustinuqa chayta

Laqha, laqhataña wasinkuman chayapusqanku.

Faustino heard this and thought about it for a
bit. Then they continued drinking and when they were drunker, they started
singing and dancing in the chichería. And after that they each went back home.
Maximiliano set out for Muruq’u Urqu and Faustino and Waltiku headed to
Kalallusta. They got home at dusk.

Karnawal raymiman iskay
qanchischaw kachkaptin, mama Inkarnawan tata Fransiskuwanqa aqhayta

risqa. Chay sukhayay pachataq achkha jak’utaqa kimsa wurupipuni chaqnaykuytawan
wasinman kutipusqa.

When it was two weeks before Carnival, it was
time for mama Inkarna and tata Fransisco to start making chicha. At dawn, mama
Inkarna went all the way to Anzaldo to have corn ground. That evening, she
loaded up three donkeys with all the ground corn and headed home.

Chay p’unchawmanta pacha;
mama Inkarna, wawankuna ima tuta p’unchaw jak’utaqa muk’uyta qallarisqanku.
Muk’u aqhata ruwanankupaqqa, jak’uta siminku ukhupi thuqayninkuwan
juq’uchananku kasqa. Juq’uyaptinñataq lliklla pataman tantananku kasqa.
Faustinuqa utqhayta jak’utaqa muk’usqa, tukuytapis muk’uspaqa atipaykusqa.

From then on, mama Inkarna and her children
started soaking the ground corn in their mouths, all day and night. In order to
make the chicha, they had to get the ground corn wet with saliva in their
mouths. When it was wet, they collected it onto a cloth. Faustino soaked the
ground corn really fast, he beat everyone at soaking corn.

Q’alitunkumantaqa kimsa
p’unchawpi muk’uyta tukusqanku. Chaymanta kimsa p’unchawpitaq chay muk’usqa
jak’uta ch’akichisqanku.

They finished soaking the corn after three
full days. Then they dried the soaked corn for another three days.

Aqhayta qallarinapaqqa,
mama Inkarna yakuta t’impuchisqa. Yaku t’impusqamantaq chay muk’usqanku jak’uta
jich’aykusqa. Juk tutatataq puqunanpaq saqirpasqa. Q’ayantin p’unchawqa pata
patanta wak paylaman wisirpasqa, chaytataq k’allkun chinkanankama t’impuchillasqataq.
Kaypata upi sutikun.

To start making the chicha, mama Inkarna
boiled water. She tossed the corn they had soaked into the boiling water. She
left it for one night to germinate. The next day, she strained the water and
filled another bowl all the way up to the top, then she boiled it again until
the acidity was gone. At this point, it is called upi.

Chay ch’isiqa, misk’i q’itata
paylapi sankhunankama chayachisqa.

That night, she cooked the germinated corn in
the bowl until it thickened into dough.

Q’ayantin p’unchawtaq,
upita t’impuchisqanta wak wirkhiman pata patanta jurqhullasqataq, chay uranpi
qunchu qhipakusqanmantataq achkha ñiqita jurqhusqanku.

The next day, she again poured the upi into
another pot to boil it, and everyone took from the dregs that were left on the
bottom of that pot.

Chaymantataq upimanqa,
mama Inkarnawan Libiritawan, Juliawan imaqa utqhayllata misk’i q’itataqa
makinkuwan q’allpiykusqanku. Chayta tukuchiytawanqa, phichqa p’unchawta

Then mama Inkarna, Libirita and Julia squeezed
the dough into little pieces with their hands in the upi. When that was done, they had chicha in five days.

Karnawal raymiman juk

juk chhikata jurqhuytawan, tata Fransiskuman llamirichisqa.

When it was one day before Carnival, mama
Inkarna uncovered the jug, took out a little bit with a small bowl, and gave it
to tata Francisco to try.

-“Q’ultin, q’ultin,
q’ultin! Sumaq aqha kasqa karaju!”- ñispa tata Fransiskuqa tutumata
ch’usaqyachisqa.

“Gulp, gulp, gulp! Damn, that’s good chicha!”
tata Fransisco said and emptied the bowl.

Mama Inkarna asirispa
paypis llamirillasqataq. Aqhaqa qhusqu, qhusqulla sumaq misk’i kasqa.

Smiling, mama Inkarna also tried some herself.
The chicha was extremely oily and very delicious.

The next day was Carnival. At dawn, everyone
was rushing around from one place to another. In mama Inkarna’s house they were
preparing corn in a big pot and a dish of new potatoes, and they were grinding
hot sauce and making tamales with a tomato-onion salad with a lot of cheese.

Chawpi p’unchawtaña
achkha runa tata Fransiskup wasinpiqa tantakusqanku: Tata Fransiskup

In the middle of the day, a lot of people
gathered at tata Francisco’s house: tata Francisco’s and mama Inkarna’s
families both came. Some other townspeople from Kalallusta came over for the
carnival festival as well. In the middle of the day, a lot of people enjoyed
the tamales, corn and the potato dish with spicy hot sauce, as well as the
tomato-onion salad. And as they ate, on top of all the food the people went to
buy chicha to drink from mama Inkarna.

Chaypi Faustinu, Waltiku, Maximiliano wak masikuna ima

Then Faustino, Waltiku, Maximiliano and some
other friends starting to play the charango, accordian and guitar. The women
hopped around, clapping loudly, and started to sing with a beautiful thin
voice. At once, all the men and women started to dance. Tata Fransisco grabbed
mama Inkarna and started dancing in the middle of the group.

As soon as they were finished eating,
Faustino, Waltiku and some other young men and women left the house in a group,
singing and dancing. Each one was all dressed up, with beautiful streamers
wrapped around their necks, and they tied small balloons to these streamers to
make them more beautiful. The women each had a little bag, which they carried
full of aphaylla.

They went into every house they came across,
jumping all around. The men played good music on the guitar, charango, bombo
and accordian. The women kept on clapping and with their thin voices they sang
with the men:

     “Maytaq kay wasiyuq? jamunki ñiwarqa!

Tukuy imaymanamanta

At Carnival that year they danced, singing
about everything and teasing each other, and they were very happy.

At dusk, when they looked up at the sky, black
clouds were beginning to gather. Suddenly the thunder crashed and they heard
the rain falling. Faustino and his friends were still walking slowly on their
way from Alfa Mayu, really drunk.

Alfa  Mayuqa juk k’acha ayllu, juk jatun urqu sikipi. Achkha yukaliktu

Pata mayutapis chimpamunaraq kasqa.

Alfa
Mayu  is a pretty town, at the foot of a big
mountain. There are a lot of yukaliktu
trees there. Not many people live in this town, there are only about ten
houses. It’s far from there to Kalallusta,
there’s a long way to walk and the P’uqru
Pata river to cross.

Para

Sapa paraptin kay mayumanqa achkha yaku unaymanta pacha yapakamun.

As soon as the rain started falling, Faustinu
and his friends got very scared, and then they worried about the P’uqru Pata river. Every time it rained,
the river filled with water after a while.

-“Utqhayta ripunachik,
amaña takinachikchu P’uqru Pata
mayupi yaku jark’aykuwasunchik”- ñispa Waltikuqa sinchi sinchimanta parlasqa.
“Let’s hurry, let’s not sing anymore, the
water in the P’uqru Pata river will
block us,” Waltiku said, calling out loudly.

-“Arí utqhayllata kutipunachik Kalallustanchikman”- ñispataq Faustinu
yapasqa.

“Yes, let’s hurry back home to our dear Kalallusta,” Faustinu added.

Chayta uyariytawankama

Then after hearing this, when everyone was
rushing back, the rain started to pour down harder. “Crash! boom!” the rain
continued to stream down. Some of them were very drunk, and were coming down
the road falling down and getting back up again comically. Others were just
coming along in the rain, talking about everything.

Waltikuwan Wadalupiwan

Waltiku and Guadalupe were walking slowly
talking, and like this they got left far behind the others. Waltiku hugged
Guadalupe. Guadalupe kept walking with him, a bit afraid. All of a sudden,
Waltiku took Guadalupe’s blanket and wrapped himself in it.

-“Mantayta qupuway”- ñispa
Wadalupiqa qhichukapuyta munasqa.

“Give me my blanket” Guadalupe said, trying to
take it back.
Para parapi Waltikuqa

kacharisqañachu. Ajinamanta chay karnawal raymi ch’isi Waltikuqa Wadalupita

In the pouring rain, Waltiku really didn’t
want to give her blanket back to her. He hugged her tighter and wouldn’t let
her go. That’s how Waltiku got Guadalupe to his house that Carnival evening.

Faustinu and the others were so drunk they
forgot all about Waltiku and Guadalupe. In the rain, they crossed the P’uqru Pata river with difficulty, the
water up to their knees. After crossing over the water, everyone went off to
their own home. Maximiliano just stayed at Faustino’s house to sleep, probably
because it was still so far from Kalallusta
to his house.

Q’ayantin p’unchaw,

The next day, Faustino and Maximiliano got up
with headaches. Mama Inkarna brought tea in two big bowls, she also offered
them one clay bowl with white corn porridge and a piece of cheese. While they
were eating this, they talked:

-“Sumaqta qayna karnawalpi
quchinchik ih?”- ñisqa Faustinu.

“We had a great Carnival yesterday, didn’t
we?” Faustino said.
-“Walliq ah”- Maximilianoqa ñisqa.

“It was good, yea” Maximiliano said.

-“Chayjinatapuni

Ajajaja! Waltiku maypi qhipakapurqari?”- ñispataq Faustinu tapurillasqataq.

“I was so incredibly drunk! I don’t remember
much about how we got here. Hahaha! and where did Waltiku end up staying?”
Faustino asked.

-“Chay karu qhipanchikta

“We left him far behind, he was walking with

-“Chaymantarí?”- ñispa Faustinu
mancharikusqa.

“And then what happened?” Faustino said,
starting to get scared.

-“Mana rikurqaniñachu, mana
yuyaniñachu ah”- asirispa Maximiliano ñillasqataq.

“I haven’t seen him since, I don’t remember
what happened” Maximiliano said, laughing.

-“Chay karaju Waltiku
Wadalupitachá ch’isi suwakapurqa, unaymantañapuni suwakapusaq ñichkarqa”- ñispa
Faustinuqa makinta uyanman churakuspa tumpata t’ukurisqa.

“That bastard Waltiku probably got Guadalupe
for the night, a while ago he said he was going to go for it,” Faustinu said,
putting his hand on his face and thinking a bit.

-“Kunan p’unchaw Muruq’u Urquman karnawalman, rillasuntaq
ih? Mamay kulli aqhata aqhachkarqa, chayta upyarimusunchik”- ñispa
Maximilianoqa Faustinuta tapurisqa.

“We’re going to Carnival again today, to Muruq’u Urqu, right? My mom was making
purple chicha, we’ll drink that there.” Maximiliano asked Faustino.

-“Risunpuni ah! Panaykita
anchatapuni ñuqa munakuni, payraykuqa may supay jutk’umanpis chayayman”- ñispa
Faustinu ñillasqataq.

“Of course we’re going! I love your sister so
much, I would go anywhere for her.” Faustino said.

-“Ajajajay! Chayllatapuni
qamqa, uña imillallaraq”- ñispa Maximiliano sinchimanta asirparikusqa.

“Hahaha! It’s always the same with you, she’s
still a young girl” Maximiliano said, bursting out laughing.

Jinamanta chawpi p’unchaw

After this, when it was midday, the two of
them headed out on foot to Muruq’u Urqu.
This place is very far from Kalallusta.
It’s called Muruq’u Urqu because this
town is like a little bowl in a mountain.

Faustinuwan
Maximilianowan Muruq’u Urqu aylluman

Fransiskitata rikuytawankama ni juk chininitapis mana payta qhawaspaqa

qhawallasqapuni.

Faustino and Maximiliano got to Muruq’u Urqu and went straight into his mother’s
house. After Faustino saw little Francisca there, he didn’t take his eyes off
of her for even a second. He kept watching her without blinking, everything she
did, how she walked.

Fransiskaqa juk k’acha uña sipas imillallaraq kasqa. Mana ancha
jatunraqchu, tumpa tullulla, uyitanqa yuraqsitu, k’acha sipaspa ñawikunitanqa
sut’i p’aqu llimp’iq, k’acha uyitanpaqjina.

Francisca was a beautiful young girl, still a
child. She wasn’t very tall yet, a little skinny, she had a small, pale face,
the beautiful girl’s small eyes were a clear brown color, she had a perfect
face.

Yuraq blusitayuq, q’umir

She was dressed in a white blouse, a green
skirt, black sandals and a white shawl. That day, she was helping her mother
sell chicha.

Jinallapi Faustinu ajinata masinta
ñisqa:

All of a sudden, Faustino said to his
friend:

-“Panaykita riqsirichiway ah!”-

“Come on, introduce me to your sister!”

-“Amallaraq ah! astawan
sukhayayllata ah, suyarikuy ah kumpay” ñispa Maximiliano kutichisqa.

“Not yet, ok! a little later, yea, wait my
friend” Maximiliano replied.

Chay p’unchawqa Faustinuwan
Maximilianowan aqhata upyaq churakusqanku, chantataq raywilata ch’anqarisqanku.

That day, Faustino and Maximiliano sat
drinking chicha, and then they played rayuela.

Chay p’unchaw Muruq’u Urqupi karnawal raymi

Because it was the day of Carnival in Muruq’u Urqu, groups of young men
came  into Maximiliano’s house one after
the other, singing. Every Carnival groups came into the houses to sing and
dance. When they sang, the owner of the house had to offer them chicha, and the
revelers had to give the owners delicious aphaylla.

Faustinuwan
Maximilianowan kimsa masikunankuwan imaqa sumaqtapuni aqhataqa upyasqanku,

Faustino, Maximiliano and three friends drank
lots and lots of chicha, and when they were a little drunk they started to sing
and dance. Faustino wanted to dance with Francisca, so he grabbed her hand and
tried to pull her over. But Francisa didn’t want to, and she escaped into the
kitchen, really frightened. She stayed in the kitchen and didn’t come out until
it was evening. Then her older brother Maximiliano saw her and led Francisca
over to Faustino.

15  Aphayllariy = aphayllata quriy.
15  Aphayllariy = to give aphaylla.
-“Fransiskita! kay
Faustinu masiyta riqsichisqayki, payqa Kalallustamanta”-
turanqa ñisqa.

“Francisca! let me introduce you to my friend
Faustino, he’s from Kalallusta.” her
brother said.

-“Imaynalla Fransiskita!
Kay juk tutuma aqhitata upyariy ah”- ñispa Faustinuqa qhawarispa juk tutumapi
aqhata jich’aytawan jaywasqa.

“How’s it going Francisca! have a little bowl
of chicha, won’t you?” Faustino said, watching her he poured out a little
chicha into a bowl and offered it to her.

Fransiskaqa

Francisca was really afraid and totally
silent, without saying anything she took the chicha and drank it. When she
finished, she quickly poured out some chicha from a little clay jug and offered
it to Faustino.

-“Fransiska, muqutilla16
t’ikita, qampaq upyaykurisaq”- ñispa Faustinuqa pampaman ch’allaykurispa
q’ultin, q’ultin! ñispa upyaykusqa.

“Francisca, muqutilla flower, I’ll drink with you.” Faustino said, he spat on
the ground and drank, gulp, gulp!

Francisca saw this and smiled. Faustino had
never see her smile, and seeing it made his heart long for her even more, this
beautiful girl. With her sweet smile, Francisca made Faustino’s heart swell up
and cry out for her. He didn’t want to be separated from her yet, so when it
was already dark and Fransisca went out, he took off after her.

-“Ama saqirpariwaychu
Fransiska, ñuqa munakuyki”- ñispa Faustinu tumpa machasqa makinmanta
jap’iykusqa.

“Don’t leave me just like that Francisca, I
love you” he said, a little drunk, he grabbed her hand.

-“Mana ripuchkanichu,

imillaqa kutichisqa.

“I’m not going away, I’m just going to look at
the sheep, they may have just left the corral,” the girl answered.

-“Jaku ñuqawan ripuna”-
k’acha imillap chumpillinmanta uqllaykuspa, Faustinuqa ñisqa.

“Let’s go, we’ll go together” Faustino said,
grabbing the lovely girl around her waist.

-“Ama jinawaychu

“Don’t do that to me, let me go! I’ll tell my
mom, let me go Faustino,” she said, struggling. The young boy still wouldn’t
let go, he just held on tighter. Then they talked for awhile.

-“Jaku ñuwaqan ripuna,
ñuqa qamta munakuyki, qamwan sawachakuyta munani”- Faustinuqa ñisqa.

“Let’s go together, I love you, I want to
marry you,” Faustino said.

Mana ni imata Fransiska
ñisqachu, ch’insitullamanta waynuchup parlasqanta uyarikusqa. Umanpiqa ajinata
t’ukurikusqa:

Francisca didn’t say anything, she listened
silently to what the young man said. In her head she thought:

-“Kay qhariqa, tata
Fransiskup wawanmin, allintachá paywanqa kawsakuyman, achkha qullqiyuqchá.
Chantapis, pay anchatapuni munakuwan.”- ñispa t’ukurikusqa.

“This man, he’s tata Francisco’s son, it could
be good to marry him, he probably has a lot of money. And also, he really loves
me,” she thought.

Jinallapi chawpi

And then, in the middle of the night, when
they were totally drunk and the moon was shining down, the two of them took
each other by the hand and headed off down the road to Kalallusta.

Ñanta purichkaspaqa Faustinuqa
ajinata t’ukurisqa:

Walking down the road, Faustino thought:

-“Imaynallatataq tataypa wasinman
munasqitaywan yaykusaqri?”- ñispa t’ukurikusqa.  “And how am I going to
go back to my father’s house with my love?” he thought.

-“Kuraq turay warminta

Chayraykutaq kuraq turay Chapare llaqtaman ripuytawan juktawan mana

t’ukullasqapuni.

“My older brother brought his woman home three
years ago, my father threw the two of them out. And because of that, my brother
went off to the Chapare and never came back again. Will he do the same to me?
Should I not go home?” he kept thinking.

Jinallapi Kalallustaman chayaytawankamaqa ichhu

As soon as they arrived in Kalallusta they
went together to the grass house and sat down and talked for a long time.
Faustino hugged Francisca, happy and a little drunk. He lifted up her skirt and
then quickly laid her down on the long grass.

-“Amaraq Faustinu! amaraq!”- ñispa
qhaparichisqa.

“Not yet, Faustino! not yet!” she cried out.

Jukninqa manapuni

The boy still didn’t let go, the two of them
stayed like that for a long time that night, making love on the hay.

Q’ayantin paqarinqa, mama Inkarna
ichhuta wakaman qarananpaq jurqhuq jamusqa.
The next morning, mama Inkarna came to take
out hay to feed the cows.

-“Faustinu! Imatataq
kaypi ruwachkanki? Maymantataq kay imillata pusamurqanki?”- ñispa mamanqa
mancharisqa qhaparisqa.

“Faustino! What are you doing here? Where did
you bring this girl here from?” his mother cried, frightened.

-“Mamay, pay Fransiska! Muruq’u Urqumanta Maximilianop sullk’a
panan. Ñuqa payta anchata munakuni. Ñuqa paywanpuni sawachakuyta munani.
Fransiskata mañaqaq rinanchikpaq tataywan parlana mamay. Yanapariway mamay.

mañakusqa.

“Mama, this is Francisca! She’s Maximiliano’s
younger sister, from Muruq’u Urqu. I
really love her. I really want to marry her. Let’s talk to papa, mama, so that
we can go and ask for Fransisca. Help me, mama. 
If I go talk to papa myself, he’ll hang me right away.” Faustino said,
begging for pity.

-“Yaykunachik tatayki chayman”-
ñispataq mama Inkarna kutichisqa.

“Let’s go in to your father,” mama Inkarna
replied.

Tata Fransiskuqa
tutamanta, achkha aycha kankata rupha ruphallata mut’iyuqta misk’ita
mikhurichkasqa. Chayllapitaq mama Inkarna, Faustinu, Fransiska ima yaykusqanku.

Tata Fransisco had been feasting since very
early in the morning, lots of steaming hot roast meat and corn porridge. And
then mama Inkarna, Faustino and Francisca came in.

-“Sumaq p’unchaw tatay.
Qam sumaq yachayniyuq, sumaq runa q’alitun kay Kalallusta ayllupi tiyakuqkunamanta kanki. Kunan ñuqa qamta

Faustinu qunqurikuspa qharijina tatanman parlarisqa.

“Good morning papa. You are so wise, you are
the best man among all of those who live in Kalallusta.
Now I would like to ask you; I want you to help me to marry Francisca.”
Faustino said, kneeling down and speaking to his father like a man.

-“Karaju! ima
yachasqaykiwan qam kay warmita uywankiri?”- ñispa tata Fransisku mikhunanta
pampata qhallirparisqa, juk rakhu k’ulluta juqharikuytawantaq sumaqninta

“Dammit! How do you think you’re going to take
care of this woman?” tata Fransisco said, throwing his food to the floor, he
picked up a thick piece of wood and started hitting his child hard.

-“Amaña tatay, amaña tatay!”-
ñispa Faustinu qhaparikusqa.

“Don’t papa, don’t!” Faustino cried.

Chayllapi panakunan
jamuytawan jark’akusqanku. Jinapitaq lisu Fransiskuqa manaña wawanta

Just then, his sisters came in and stopped
him. And then mean Francisco didn’t beat his child anymore.

Mana mamalla nitaq tatalla mañaqaymanqa rinmanchu kasqa. Chayraykutaq
Faustinuqa sinchita tatanta qunqurchakimanta mañaqapi yanaparinanpaq mañakusqa.

In Kalallusta,
if a man wanted to marry a woman, then both the man’s father and mother had to
go and ask for the woman’s hand. It couldn’t be just the mother or just the
father who went to ask. Because of this, Faustino begged his father from his
knees to help him in asking for Francisca’s hand.

Chayjinamanta chay
p’unchawqa parlaq churakusqanku, Fransiskata mañaqaq rinankupaq.

And then, they started to talk that day about
going to ask for Francisca’s hand.

-“Sumaqta wayk’unachik,
chantapis achkha aqhata apananchik tiyan”- ñispa tata Fransiskuqa phiña
phiñalla parlarisqa.

“We’ll cook some delicious food, and then we
also have to bring a lot of chicha.” tata Fransisco said, a little annoyed.

Ajinatataq ruwasqanku.
Q’ayantin paqarin sut’iyaymanta phichqa wallpata ñak’aytawan samata

Fransiskuqa jatun kawallunman khapataykuytawan, k’uyunanta pitarispa tukuyta
karu qhipapi saqirparispa, ñawpaqta kachaykukusqa.

And that’s what they did. The next day at dawn
they killed five chickens and cooked the food to take with them. They also
prepared four jugs of chicha and loaded them on to a donkey. Then tata
Fransisco, mama Inkarna, Faustino and Francisca headed off for Muruq’u Urqu. Tata Francisco mounted a
big horse, and smoking his cigarette he went on ahead, leaving everyone else
behind.

Muruq’u Urqu man chayaytawanqa,
punkuta takaykurisqanku. Fransiskap maman lluqsimusqa. Juk juch’uy warmi. Tumpa

When they got to Muruq’u Urqu, they knocked on the door. Fransisca’s mother came
out. She was a small woman. A few freckles, green eyes, light brown face.

-“Sumaq p’unchaw”- ñispa
napaykurisqa.

“Goodday” she said, greeting them.

-“Sumaq p’unchaw, ñuqayku
qamkunawan parlarikuq jamuchkayku”- ñispa mama Inkarna kutichisqa.

“Goodday, we are coming to talk with you,”
mama Inkarna replied.

-“Yaykurimullaychik”-
ñispataq mama Asteria, Fransiskap mamanqa wasin ukhuman, chaypi sumaqta

“Come on in,” said mama Asteria. Francisca’s
mother went into her house, where they could talk more easily.

Yaykuytawanqa, wurumanta
aqhata jurayk’achisqanku, mikhunatapis pampaman muyullata churasqanku,
ajinamantataq parlayta qallarisqanku:

They went in, unloaded the chicha from the
donkey, and put the food on the floor in a circle, and then they started to
talk:

-“Kay qhari waway
karnawal raymipi juchacharpakusqa, wawaykichikta wasiyman pusamusqa”- ñispa
tata Fransisku qallarisqa.

“My child, this man, has just sinned at
Carnival, he brought your child to my house,” tata Francisco began.

-“Kunanri kumpadri
wawakunanchik ña juchachakunkuña, paykuna munanakunku, sawachakuchunku ah”-
ñispataq llakisqa Fransiskap tatanqa, tata Leoncioqa, ñisqa. Leoncioqa juk muqu

“And now, my friend, when our children have
already sinned, they love each other and they should get married.” Francisca’s
father, tata Leoncio, said sadly. Leoncio was a hunchbacked man. A skinny guy.
With a brown poncho. There was a bag of coca hanging from his neck.

-“Wawayqa mana

wayk’ukuyta yachan. Imaynatataq pay qharinman imatapis jaywanqari?”- ñispa mama
Asteria t’ukuspa ñisqa.

“My
child doesn’t know how to cook or clean well yet, she just knows how to make
clear soup. How will she offer anything to her man?” mama Asteria said,
thoughtfully.

-“Ña juchachakunkuña!
Sawanchakunanku tiyan!”- ñispa tata Fransiskuqa sinchimanta parlaspa tukuyta
ch’inyarpachispa.

“They have already sinned! They have to get
married!” tata Francisco yelled, silencing everyone.

-“Jina kaptinqa, mayk’aqpaqtaq
sawachaku kanman, tatay?”- Tata Leoncioqa tapusqa.

“That’s how it will be, when should the
wedding be, tata?” Tata Leoncio asked.

-“Kunan kachkanchik
chunka iskayniyuq p’unchaw jatun puquy killapi, qhipan killaqa pacha puquy
killa, chay iskay p’unchawpi kachun”- ñispa lisu Fransisku kutichisqa.

“Today is February 12th, next month
is March, the wedding will be March 2nd.” mean Francisco answered.

17  Ch’usaq lawa = lawa yakuyuq kachiyuq jak’uyuq imalla.
17  Empty soup = soup with just water, salt and
corn.
-“Jina kachun”- ñispa tukuy

“That’s how it will be” everyone said.

After this, mama Inkarna offered the food she
had brought to everyone. And everyone ate the food, and on top of this they
drank lots of chicha. Once they were drunk, they danced until dawn.

When it was March 2nd, Faustino got
up at dawn and headed off from Kalallusta
with his father, mother and family to Anzaldo.
At the same time, Francisca, welldressed in white, came on foot with her mother
and father from Muruq’u Urqu.

Iñiy wasipiqa tata kuraqa ñisqa:

In the church the priest said:

-“Faustinu, qam kay
warmiwan wañunaykikama kawsanaykipaq sawachakuyta munankichu?”-

“Faustino, do you want to marry this woman,
and live with her until you die?”

-“Arí tatay”- ñispa
kutichisqa. Umanpitaq ajinata t’ukurisqa. “Ñuqa paywan wañupunaykamapuni
kawsakusaq, mana payta wak warmiwan wasanchasaqchu. Payllatapuni munakusaq.”

“Yes, father” he answered. In his head he
thought: “I will live with her until the day I die, I will not betray her with
other women. I will always love only her.”

-“Qamri Fransiska? Kay
qharita sumaqta munakunaykipaq, paywan kawsanaykipaq, wayk’upunaykipaq
munankichu?”- ñispa tata kura tapurisqa.

“And you Francisca? Do you want this man, to
cook for him, to live with him and to love him well?” the priest asked.

-“Arí tatay”- ñispa kutichisqa.

“Yes father” she answered.

-“Jina kaptinqa jatun
tatanchikpa sutinpi qamkuna saqachasqa kankichik. Kunanmanta pacha
wañupunaykichikkama, mana phiñanakuspa, mana maqanakuspa, mana t’aqanakuspa.”-
ñispa tata kuraqa misata tukuchisqa.

“Let it be, in the name of our father, you are
married. From now until the time of your death, may you not be angry with each
other, not fight with each other, not separate from each other.” the priest
said, finishing the mass.

Iñiy wasimanta tukuy

Everyone went out of the church. They put

–“Iñiy wasillamanta lluqsirpamuchunku ah”- ñisqa lisu Fransiskuqa.

Francisca’s parents prepared a big party at
their house in Muruq’u Urqu.
Faustino’s relatives didn’t prepare anything. “They’re just leaving from the
church, right?” mean Fransisco said.

-“Muruq’u Urquman rinachik, chaypi wak’urqayku, chantapis aqhatawan
wakichirqayku”- ñispa tata Leoncio tukuyman parlasqa.

“Let’s all go to Muruq’u Urqu, we cooked there, and also made chicha” tata Leoncio
said, speaking to everyone.

“We’re going back right away”, Faustino’s
friends said, distancing themselves a bit from the group. And just like that,
they went off to Kalallusta.
Francisca’s friends were still waiting in the door of the church, curious. When
they still hadn’t appeared, Faustino went to call his friends, but no one
wanted to come. He went back to the door of the church, sobbing. Sad and alone,
he headed off to Muruq’u Urqu with
some of his wife’s family. Right afterwards, Waltiku and Guadalupe set off
after Faustino to Muruq’u Urqu.

Many people ate and danced at the party.
People went up to the bride and groom to give them money and they gave more to
the bride, they gave maybe only a fifth as much to the groom. Francisca’s money
was in a circle on her back. After seeing this, the people grumbled “These two
will live like cats and dogs”.

Thirteen years after the wedding, Faustino and
Francisca had three kids; first Guillermo, then Luwisa, and the youngest child
was Albino.

Faustino and Francisca lived sadly in these
years. They just worked in the fields all year round, every year; they grew
wheat, potatoes, corn, fava beans and quinoa. Everyday, mama Francisca took the
animals to graze on the hill. All three children went to school in Anzaldo from
Monday to Friday.

Tata Faustino and Mama Francisca didn’t live
well at all during those years, they were always angry with one another.
Everytime Faustino drank chicha, he’d hit his wife and give her black eyes.
Sometimes when mama Francisca had gone to Muruq’u
Urqu he would get drunk, and then she would have problems with her husband.

Tata Faustino was a knowledgeable man, like
his father. At the time his father died, he could make wooden spoons very well,
and he took them to the market in Cliza
to sell along with his produce.

During those years, everyone who lived in Anzaldo loaded whatever they had grown
onto donkeys and took it to Cliza to
sell.

Long before 1960 the members of the MNR party,
Hernan Siles Suazo, Carlos Montenegro, Walter Guevara Arce, Juan Lechin, and
even tata Victor Paz Estenssoro, were working hard for the MNR party. Together,
they won the 1952 revolution.

Then, while they were all working together,
everyone looked at each other and because of the problems they divided
themselves between tata Walter Guevara Arce and tata Victor Paz Estenssoro.
They suddenly betrayed one another and from that moment on they really hated
each other. Then they began a big war. Tata Victor Paz Estenssoro’s men, tata
Pedro Carita, tata Fermin Torrico and tata Rosendo Causiri, went to San Pedro de Buena Vista in Norte Potosí prepare to

fight well. Earlier, there was a small fight
in the town of Ukureña18,
and they had prepared for that one in advance too. Victor Paz Estenssoro’s men
went to Norte Potosí because it was
said that there the citizens worked for the MNR. The people in Ukureña wanted to kill.

Tata Walter Guevara Arceta’s men trained in Ukureña, they were tata Jorge Solís,
tata José Rojas, tata Juvenal Castro and tata Miguel Veizaga. They really loved
the people of Valle Alto[9]; Ukureña, Cliza, Chiliqchi, Toco and Anzaldo.  [9] [9]

In 1960, tata Victor Paz Estenssoro’s men
wanted to head out to Ukureña, but
first they tried to silence the town of Yambata.
Yambata is a big town in between Norte Potosí and Cochabamba. Because of
this, tthe men came through Yambata
twice and sacked the town, they beat the people, killed the animals, went into
the townspeople’s homes and took all of their things for themselves. The houses
were silent, there was nothing left. The fighting and killing went on for three
months in Yambata. Victor Paz
Estenssoro’s men, tata Fermin Torrico, Pedro Carita and Rosendo Causiri, really
made the people in Yambata suffer.
“You’re communists” they accused. They wanted to capture the leaders of Yambata and kill them. They were always
saying, “We have to make the communists disappear”.

Tata Hernan Peralta was born in Yambata. At
that time, he was working in a mine in Llallagua[11].
When he learned about how the people in his town of Yambata were suffering, he came from the mine in two trucks with
men to help. In Yambata there were
still thirty Beneméritos left from the Chaco
war, they fought one another hard, their blood falling to the ground in the
battle. This battle went on for three months in Yambata. Many people died, and when someone died like this his body
was left where it was. The dogs took a person’s hands or feet in their mouths
and brought them to their house. The battle was very sad.  [11] [11]

The battle was in Yambata because this town is in between Norte Potosí and Cochabamba. Afterwards, people from Yambata were called “bloody hands”.

As soon as the battle was over, tata Victor
Paz Estenssoro’s men were training themselves to go straight to Ukureña and Cochabamba. They thought in
their heads:

“Viñanta chimpasunchik, Anzaldo

“We’ll cross Viña, kill everyone in Anzaldo,
and then we’ll slaughter everyone in Ukureña,
we’ll be known for this all over Boliva.” Viña
is a small town separate from Cochabamba and Toro Toro, there is a big river called the Caine there.

As soon as they learned of this, tata Walter
Guevara’s men, tata Jorge Solís, tata José Rojas, tata Juvenal Castro and tata
Miguel Veizaga, asked for help from everyone from the towns in this area. Tata
Miguel Veizaga was well respected in Cliza,
so he was the one who went to ask for help. And tata  José Rojas was well respected in Ukureña, and the surrounding area. Tata
Juvenal Castro was the mayor of Anzaldo,
and so everyone also knew him. Like this, tata Walter Guevara Arce’s men
prepared themselves to fight with Estenssoro’s men in Viña. They went around to every single community and asked for help
from all the residents.

In Kalallusta,
a pututu cried one morning at
dawn. After hearing this, all the residents went to gather in a group. Faustino
and Waltiku got to the door of the school quickly.

When all the residents were gathered together,
a big meeting began. First, the mayor of Kalallusta,
Valerio Soto, said:

-“Munasqa ayllumasikuna,

parlasqa.

“Dear citizens, listen well. All of us who
live in these communities have seen ourselves in a great hardship. If we don’t
do anything, then we’ll find ourselves in a worse situation. This morning
Juvenal Castro, the mayor of Anzaldo,
has come to talk with us. Now he’ll tell us what we’re going to do.” Valerio
said.

Ajinata jatun umalliq Juvenal
qallarisqa:

Mayor Juvenal began like this:

-“Kalallustamanta ayllu masikuna, juk jatun napaykuy qamkunapaq
kachun. Valerio Soto ñisqanman jina ñuqa Anzaldomanta

“Citizens of Kalallusta, a big greeting to you all. As Valerio Soto said, I’m
the mayor of Anzaldo, and so I work for Walter Guevara with all my heart,” he
said loudly.

-“Kunanqa juk llakiyta

“I come now to tell you about a tragedy.
Citizens! Over in Yambata Victor Paz
Estenssoro’s men have really made the people suffer, they killed them, and took
everything from them. Now they are already preparing to come to Anzaldo, and
kill us the same way. We won’t just watch that happen! We have to go fight!”
Tata Juvenal said loudly, shaking.

Kalallusta  ayllumasikunaqa
sinchimanta mancharikusqanku, uyankuqa pukayarisqa ninrinkupis qhichiyarisqa
chayta uyariptinkuqa. Ni ima ñispa ch’inllamanta uyarillasqankupuni.

The Kalallusta
townspeople were very afraid, when they heard this their faces turned red
and their ears perked up. No one said anything, they listened in perfect
silence.

-“Kunanqa, qamkuna ¿Imata

¡Mana chaytaqa ñuqanchik qhawakullasunmanchu! Tukuy qharikuna ¡maqanakuq

tata Juvenal Castro parlasqa.

“Now, what will you all do? You must group
together and buy guns! We will go to war! If we don’t go, then in a week they
will begin killing all the people and the animals and emptying our houses! We
won’t just watch! Every single man, we will fight! There will be a big battle
in Caine Mayu,” tata Juvenal Castro
said.

Tukuy ayllumasikunaqa

All the townspeople kept listening silently.
When it had been quiet for a little while, all the townspeople got very angry.
They all muttered among themselves about Victor Paz Etenssoro.

-“Ajina ayllumasikuna,

tiyan, chantapis sapa phichqa qutu juk phusilta rantikunaykichik tiyan”- ñispa
yaparisqa.

“So, citizens, from this moment on, we must
get ready! All the men must go to fight, and so every group of five must buy a
gun,” he added.

-“¿Machkhapitaq chay
phusilkunari?”- ñispa juk runa tapurikusqa.

“And how much are these guns?” one person
asked.

-“Sapa juk, 150, 200, 300

“Each one is 150, 200 or 300 Bolivianos. You
have to go buy the guns from tata Julian’s house in Anzaldo. A week from now, everyone has to go fight. Tata Valerio,
if you were to pick one man to be in charge, who would you pick?” tata Juvenal
asked.

-“¡Tata Waltiku kachun
ah! qamkuna ayllumasikuna, ¿Imaninkichiktaq?”- ñispa tata Valerioqa tapusqa.

“It should be tata Waltiku! townspeople, what
do you think?” tata Valerio asked.

Tata Waltiku had been living in Kalallusta since he was a child, he was
good at killing birds and juq’uri[13]. He
lived a good life with his wife Guadalupe and their four children.  [13] [13]

-“Arí, arí, pay sumaqta

“Yes, yes, he knows how to kill yuthu, juq’uri and wisk’acha
very well, maybe we’ll win if he’s in charge. What do you think?” Faustino
said, talking about his dear friend.

-“Jina kachun, tata
Waltiku, qam kay Kalallusta

“That’s how it will be, tata Waltiku, you must
lead your fellow men from Kalallusta
well. Now I must go to Rodeo, Alfa Mayu, Tarku Luma, Thapaya, Viña and some other towns. I’ll leave so
you can coordinate with each another. In one week we’ll all meet in Viña. Citizens! we’ll see each other
soon” tata Juvenal said, packing up his things and heading off to Viña.

Ripuptinkamaqa tukuy

As soon as he had gone, everyone prepared like
tata Juvenal had said. They gathered in groups of five to buy guns. But tata
Faustino didn’t get together with anyone.

Qutuchanaku tukukuptinqa
tukuy wasinkuman ripusqanku. Faustinupis wasinman chayaytawan mama Fransiskaman

When everyone had finished grouping off, they
all went back home. Faustino also went home, and when he arrived he told mama
Francisca everything.

-“¿Qamri, pikunawantaq phusilta
rantinkiri?”- ñispa mama Fransiska tapusqa.

“And what about you? Who are you going to buy
a gun with” mama Francisca asked.

-“¡Ni piwan karaju! ¡Sapa
sapitas karaju! ñuqa sapay juk phusilta rantikusaq!”- ñispa Faustinu
kutichisqa.

“No one, damnit! All by my damn self! I’ll buy
the gun alone!” Faustino answered.

-“¿Maymantataq qullqita
apamusunchik? mana kapuwanchikchuqa”- ñispa warminqa phiñarikusqa.

“Where will we get the money? We don’t have
it,” his wife said, getting mad.

Q’ayantin p’unchawqa

ranqhasaq chantataq phusilta rantikusaq”- ñispa.

The very next morning three traders from Viña went to Anzaldo, leading their cows. As soon as he saw this, Fautsino
thought “I’ll sell my white cow and then I’ll buy a gun”.

Mañasukunaman chimpaykuytawan
napaykusqa chantataq ajinata ñisqa:

He crossed over to the traders and greeted
them, then he said:

-“Juk yuraq waka kapuwan,
ranqhayta munani, ichapis qamkuna rantiyta munawaqchik”- ñisqa.

“I have a white cow, I want to sell it, maybe
you want to buy it from me,” he said.

Waka mañasukunaqa,
jinallatapuni puriykachaq kanku, wakata, uwijata, khuchikunata rantiytawan, Cliza chiruman apamuspa chaypi astawan

The cattle-traders bought cows, sheep and
pigs, and then brought them to Cliza
where they sold them for a lot more money, they were walking all around doing
this.

Jinamanta jaqay

uywakunankuta ranqhasqanku.

So, as part of this, these traders bought
Faustino’s white cow. Mama Francisca didn’t want to sell it, she stayed inside
and cried in distress when the lenders took away her white cow for themselves.
With the money from selling the cow, Faustino bought himself a gun. All the
townspeople sold their livestock like this in order to buy guns.

On Sunday at dawn all the men of Kalallusta gathered at the door of the
school. That was the day they were to go to Viña
to battle. Each one carried dried food in a shawl. In these shawls, they
carried some toasted corn, pitu, phiri, and roasted potatoes. That day
all the women were also with their husbands, everyone in the town waited for
them to arrive.

Tata Waltiku ñisqa:

Tata Waltiku said:

-“Tukuypis   phichqamanta        phichqa

“All of you have grouped off, five by five,

Then the women started to cry, the children
also started to cry, saying “Papa, don’t leave us alone”. Some of the women
also mumbled among themselves.

-“Ichapis qusanchikta

“Perhaps we will see the death of our
husbands” all the women said among themselves, crying.

Tukuy qharikunataq juk

All the men lined up, and then they set off
for Viña.

-“Juk, iskay, kimsa, jakuchik”-
ñispa qhaparispa puririsqanku. Ñanta richkaspaqa, takirispa qhapariykacharispa

“One, two, three, let’s go” they called out as
they walked. Going down the road, they continued along singing and calling out.

The women, children and grandparents stayed
behind at the school door, just crying sadly. Those days, all the towns in the Anzaldo area were very quiet, there were
no men to be seen. All the men had gone off to the war.

As they were walking towards Viña, the group of people marching
toward battle grew bigger and bigger. At each little town they arrived in, more
and more people joined. Close to 200 men arrived in Viña.

There is a big river in Viña. Tata Victor Paz Estenssoro’s men were marching south from the
river; his leader was tata Rosendo Causiri. Rosendo Causiri’s righthand man was
was Casto Via, ‘the cow wrangler’. Walter Guevara Arce’s men were to the north
of the Viña river, towards Anzaldo, they were tata Juvenal Castro,
Jorge Solís, Miguel Veizaga and José Rojas.

Tata Estenssoro’s men wanted to kill every
person and animal, they were coming to empty every house from Toro Toro to Anzaldo. They were coming well prepared. They Tata Walter Guevera’s
men were waiting at the Caine river
in Viña, they had to stop
Estenssoro’s men from crossing the river.

From the moment they arrived, the men started
firing their guns vigorously. Some were from Anzaldo, and others from Toro
Toro. Each of the townspeople had sandals on their feet and a gun in their
hand, all day and all night you could hear them exploding “Boom! Boom! Boom!”.
The woman walked around crying hard, hearing all this. They thought their
husbands might already be dead. In those days, all the womens hearts trembled
with sadness. The women were all walking around with broken hearts.

Sapa iskay p’unchaw warmikunaqa mut’ita, papa wayk’uta,

Every two days the women were up at dawn
preparing corn, cooked potatoes, toasted corn, phiri, pitu, and roasted
potatoes to take to their husbands. With all the grandparents and young boys
they loaded the dried food labeled for the men onto donkeys to carry it. They
brought food each time. The women didn’t have any cloth left to wrap the food
in and since they couldn’t do anything else, they ripped the lining of their
skirt and carried the food in this.

Ch’ampa awqanakuypiqa

They didn’t eat well in the war. They were
constantly firing their guns at each other. They would quickly hide behind some
rocks and eat in a hole they had dug.

Mana sumaqtapischu puñuq

They didn’t sleep well either. When they were
just too tired, they went behind a rock or a tree, or in a hole, clutching
their guns.

One day the men from Anzaldo were walking along the edge of the the river towards Soyco. Soyco is south of Viña,
on the way to Aiquile; they grow good
corn, melon, lemon, sweet potato, wayaba and potatoes there.

Tukuy chay chiruman

When they were all walking, it was the time of
year when the corn was good and ripe. When they saw the corn, everyone broke
off into groups and picked the cobs of corn. Then all the people from Soyco, and those from Anzaldo, cooked boiled corn in an
enormous bowl. Everyone ate the delicious food.

During all this, the men from Toro Toro arrived in Soyco, at the bank of the river. They
were good and ready to attack the next day and kill everyone.

That night there was a torrential rainstorm.
Every time it rained, lots of murky water filled the Caine river, and people couldn’t cross the river, even cars
couldn’t cross the river. If someone should enter the river, they would soak up
the water like a corn cob.

Q’ayantin paqarinpaqqa Soyco qayllapi Tunal aylluman chayaspa, Anzaldo

The very next morning, the people from Anzaldo
wanted to cross the Caine river on
their way to the town of Tunal, near Soyco. The murky water was swirling in
the river. Seeing all the water moving around like that, the leader said:

-“Tumpata yaku
pisiyaptinkama phichqa chunka runa qutuchakuspa, sumaqta makinchikmanta
jap’inaykukuytawan mayuta chimpasunchik. Wakintaq urqu pataman wasariytawan

“As soon as the water has gone down a little
bit, 50 of us will break off and cross the river, holding each other’s hands
tightly. The others must climb to the top of the mountain and shoot
Estensorro’s group.”

Jinamanta paykunapura

Chay qutupiqa Faustinu, Waltiku, Ricardo wakkuna ima chimpachkasqanku.

Then, altogether, they began to cross the
water in a group, holding tightly to one another’s hands. Faustino, Waltiku,
Ricardo and some others were crossing in this group.

Chayta rikuspaqa

walasqa, yakuman runakunap ñawpaqinman, wak chirullaman chayamusqa.

Estenssoro’s group got very scared when they
saw this. They fired down at those who were crossing. From the top of the
mountain, the men from Anzaldo fired
back, hard. Estensorro’s group fired more on the people in the water. But they
didn’t hit anyone. The bullets landed splish! splash! into the water in front
of them, or right to their side.

Tata Walter Guevarap

Tata Walter Guevara’s group crossed, and
Estenssoro’s group got very frightened. Ricardo, from Anzaldo, shot once and killed Rosendo Causiri’s friend, after
seeing this he peed on himself in fear.

Walter Guevara’s men, shooting from the bank
of the river fell to the ground like corn cobs. Estenssoro’s group saw that
there was nowhere to escape to; some escaped into a tree, behind a rock,
throwing their guns. Others knelt and said:

-“Ama wañuchiwaychu tatay”-

“Don’t kill me, tata”

Chaypiqa may chhika

The men from Anzaldo got many guns like this. And with the guns they gathered
up, they shot and killed Estenssoro’s men.

¡Ni pi kasqachu! Tata
Walter Guevarap runallanña rikhurisqanku. Manaraqtaq chaykamaqa Rosendo
Causirita wañuchisqankuraqchu.
No one was left! Only tata Walter Guevara’s
men were visible. Up until this point, though, they still hadn’t killed Rosendo
Causiri.

Rosendo Causiriqa juk

Rosendo Causiri was on top of a mountain, he
had built up a little house-like shelter with small rocks. This structure was
for him to lie down in alone. As soon as he lied down there, he grabbed his gun
and silently tried to shoot.

Chaypitaq Sacabamba ayllumanta Ricardo rikurquytawan ajinata qhaparisqa:

Just then, Ricardo, from Sacabamba, saw him and called:

-“Kaypi Causiri karichkan”-

“Causiri is right here”

-“¡Phum! ¡Phum! ¡Phum!- ñispataq
Causiriqa Ricardota wañuchipusqa.

“Pow! pow! pow! sounded, and Causiri killed
Ricardo.

Chayllapi Braulio Vega Kalallustamanta Rosendo Causirita

Suddenly, Braulio Vega, from Kalallusta, saw Rosendo Causiri clearly
from behind.

-“Jaqaypi chay karaju

“That jerk is lying down over there” he said
to Waltiku, pointing with his hand.  -“¿Maypi
ah? ¿maypi?”- ñispa Waltikuqa rikuyta mana atisqachu.

“Where, where?” Waltiku said, he couldn’t see
him.

Chayllapitaq Waltikuqa

Suddenly Waltiku saw Causiri, instantly
pointed his gun at him, and took him down with a “pow!”. He got Causiri in the
middle of the back and killed him. Waltiku stood for about three minutes after
shooting, without speaking or moving his gun. Then everyone came quickly to
where Causiri was. They turned his body over to take Causiri’s gun.

-“ajajajay”- ñispa Causiriqa
asirisqa, manaraq sumaqtachu wañusqa.

“hahaha” Causiri laughed, he wasn’t dead yet.

-“Karaju asirikuwaqraq

“You’re still laughing, you jerk” they put
three sticks of dynamite in his ass. 
Then they lit the dynamite and he was immediately thrown up into the
air. After that, there was nothing left to be seen of Causiri’s body, just a
big pile of flesh stuck on

23  Julo = juk k’acha ayllu Viña aylluman chayanapi.
23  Julo = a beautiful town on the way to Viña.
top of the trees. That was all that was left
of Causiri. Seeing this, everyone from Causiri’s group disappeared to wherever.
Even the Cow-Wrangler disappeared, after leaving the coffin in the Julo23 church for the corpse.

Manaraq ch’ampa awqanakuy

Before the war, Rosendo Causiri had bought a
coffin. Then he had said to the CowWrangler:

-“Sumaqtapuni kay tawa
k’uchuta jallch’anki, ichapis ñuqata ch’ampa awqanakuypi wañuchiwanqanku, kay
tawa-k’uchupipuni p’ampawankichik”-.

“Be sure to keep this coffin, if they kill me

But it wasn’t to be like that, they made
Causiri disappear altogether with one sad stick of dynamite. And after taking
Causiri’s gun for themselves, tata Walter Guevara’s men said “we got you,
jackass!”, and they were happy.

They picked up Ricardo’s sad body and while
they were carrying it back to Anzaldo
they stopped in the Julo church to
rest. They went in to the church. Inside, Causiri’s coffin was empty and
abandoned.

Chay tawa-k’uchuta Waka

The Cow-Wrangler was watching that coffin.
When they killed Causiri, after they left, he escaped and hid somewhere. The
men from Anzaldo found the coffin on
its own, put Ricardo’s body inside, and then, sad and hungry, they started to
walk in procession with the body.

Ch’ampa awqanakuypi

The victors in the war filled the road like
ants, coming in a procession with the coffin. The women became frightened when
they saw this, and they came crying out onto the road to watch, perhaps this
corpse could be their husband.

The men had dirty clothes, with holes and
tears, their sandals were broken too, they were dying of hunger. At every house
they came across, they went into the kitchen and emptied the pots of boiled
corn and soup.

When they were coming in to Kalallusta, mama Francisca ran from the
mountain, falling down and getting up again, leaving the sheep on their own.
When she saw the coffin, tears started flowing from her eyes.

-“Faustinuy wañusqa

“What will I do if my Faustino has died? my
little man, my little child!” she said. Inside, her heart trembled violently.
Then she saw Faustino and her heart lept. After that, she quickly went to
prepare some empty soup.

Mankata yakuyuqta

She filled the pot with water, mixed in the
dried corn, put it on the fire to boil and then served the soup to her husband
when it was nice and hot. Faustino was so hungry he gobbled up the boiling hot
soup, slurping down every delicious bite.

Albino and little Guillermo saw their father’s
two guns and asked him about everything that had happened. And their father
told mama Francisca and his children everything. As they listened to tata
Faustino, they were both sad and happy.

Some of the men went back home when they got
to Anzaldo, and others carried
Ricardo’s dead body all the way to his home in Sacabamba. Ricardo’s wife let out a loud sob and then kept crying
as she looked at her dead husband.

Jinapitaq chay Anzaldo chirupi ch’ampaykuna ch’inyasqa.

And then, just like that, the battle in Anzaldo fell quiet. Rosendo Causiri, of
tata Victor Paz Estenssoro’s men, had died, they didn’t know anything about
tata Pedro Carita. They killed tata Fermin Torrico over in Cochira[15], he
was killed in a sad way, they cut off his head right away, and then made his
wife carry it in her shawl to the San
Pedro de Buena Vista Plaza, dripping blood. In that plaza they kicked
Torrico’s head back and forth like a ball, laughing.  [15] [15]

By the year 1965, mama Francisca and tata
Faustino already had four children. In order, they were: Guillermo, then
Luwisa, and then Albino, and Fortunato was the youngest. Everyday, their lives
were very sad. Their fields didn’t produce much anymore. They suffered a lot
over food. Faustino’s relatives had gone to work in the Chapare when tata Francisco and mama Inkarna died. Sometimes
Apolonio and his wife Gabina also lived in Kalallusta,
but other times they didn’t. His older sister Libirata had gone to Cochabamba.

“Go home, and bring back a piece of rope to

The young boy, happy by himself, headed back
saying:

-“Yayawki Apolonioqa iskay

“Uncle Apolonio traded me this beautiful belt
for two eggs”

Ajinallatapuni kusisqa

Like this, Albino continued to walk happily.
That day while he was going home, he saw uncle Albino and mama Gabina carrying
sugarcane in the river.

-“Sumaq p’unchaw yayawkiy”- ñispa

“Good day uncle” he said, greeting him.

“Good day my child” they said, greeting him

They finished threshing the wheat that day.
Tata Faustino, Francisca and the children were so tired, they ate phiri and went straight to sleep.

Q’ayantin sut’iyaytaqa, phichqa

The next morning, Albino got up at 5:00 am to
drink some water.

-“¡Ay! Sumaqta ch’akiykuchkawan”-
ñispa.

“Ay! I’m so thirsty” he said.

Chayta uyarispaqa mama

Mama Fracisca heard this,

“What was that my little child? are you

The child went to the water, scooped out some
water in a little bowl and drank,

-“Chayqa, sumaqta saqsayarparini”-
ñispa puñuykakapusqa.

“There, now I’m satisfied,” he said, and went
to sleep.

Mama Fransiska astawan

Mama Francisca was really frightened, she got
up and walked over to Albino.

-“¿Imanantaq wawitay? ¿imatachu

“What is it, my child? what did you want?” she
asked, scared.

-“Qayna yayawki

ñispa kutichisqa.

“Yesterday uncle Apolonio and mama Gabina were

Tata Faustino’s ran to his brother Apolonio’s
house, and he and Apolonio brought back the sugarcane. They strained the
sugarcane   with a spoon and
poured it into his mouth. All of a sudden, the child just died.

Mama Fransiska wawanta

Mama Francisca started to cry in distress as
she watched her child die. Tears of sadness streamed from tata Faustion’s eyes
as well. Uncle Apolonio felt sad and angry.

-“¡Ñuqa juchayuq kani!
Manamá juk kañata jaywariyman karqa”- ñispa umanpi paña makinwan waqtakusqa.

“I’m guilty! I should have given him the

That day in the house, mama Francisca and some
of her neighbors made a lot of empty soup. Tata Faustino and Apolonio went to Anzaldo to buy a coffin. Faustino didn’t
have a cent, or even a single boliviano, and he cried. He wanted to borrow from
Apolonio. His brother Apolonio felt bad and gave him the money, and then they
went to buy a white coffin to bury the child.

That night they held a vigil for the dead
body. And the very next day, they buried little Albino. Everyone cried in
anguish at the cemetery. As they were crying, the sun went down. Everyone went
back to the house. They also brought back the chicha they had carried with
them. Then mama Gabina said:

-“Ama aqhata wasiman
apaykuychikchu, watiqmanta mama Fransiskapaq llakiy chayamullanqañataq”-.

“Let’s not take chicha to the house, it’ll
only make Francisca sad again.”

Mana

They didn’t listen, they carried all of chicha
into the house in small jugs and they kept drinking until they couldn’t stand
up.

Nine days later, tata Faustino and mama
Francisca went alone to Anzaldo to
give a mass for Albino. Some of their neighbors found out and came too. When
the mass was over, everyone went home. Mama Francisca and her husband arrived
home hungry. There wasn’t even rotten corn in their house. The children begged,
with their mouths hanging open from hunger too:

-“Mamay yarqhawayku”- ñisqa,
Luwisaqa.

“Mama, we’re hungry,” said Luwisa.

Chayta uyarispaqa tata
Faustinu warminwan wasi ukhuman yaykuspa sinchita llakirikusqanku.

When they went into their house and heard
this, tata Faustino and his wife got very sad.

Mama Fransiska wayk’una

Tukuy lawata mikhuykuytawan puñuykakapusqanku.

Mama Francisca went into the kitchen. There
wasn’t anything to eat. There was some wheat in an old sack in one corner, but
there wasn’t even enough of that. She made some empty soup from that wheat, and
served it to her husband and children. That soup is made from just water, salt
and a bit of dried fat. They didn’t eat any carrots or onions. When they
finished all the soup, they went to bed.

Q’ayantin p’unchawqa tata Faustinu
warminman ajinata ñisqa:

The next day tata Faustino said to his wife:

-“¿Wawakunata, imawantaq

“How will we take care of the children? Will
we kill them with hunger? No! I’m going to Cochabamba right now, my older
sister Libira lives there, I’ll go to her house. I’ll work for money, and then
in a month I’ll come back. Until then, you’ll take the sheep to graze, and take
good care of the children. You’ll sell one sheep and then go buy potatoes, corn
and wheat. And I’ll come back when I’ve made some money. I’ll buy some potato
seeds and bring them back for us to plant, and then I’ll go back again, and that’s
how we’ll live from now on.”

When he had said this, he took out his coca
bag, wrapped up three changes of clothes in a shawl and headed off for
Cochabamba on foot. He got to Cliza
at midday. Tata Juvenal Castro had a house in Cliza. When Faustino though of this, he went to his house.

-“¿Imaynalla kakuchkanki tata
Faustinu?”- ñisqa Juvenalqa.

“How are you doing, tata Faustino?” Juvenal
said.

-“¡Waliqlla ah! ¿qamri?”- ñispataq
kutichisqa.

“Great, and you?” he answered.

-“¿Mayman kachaykukuchkankiri?”-
ñispa tata Juvenal tapullasqataq.

“Where are you heading?” tata Juvenal asked.

-“Quchapampaman, Libirata
panaypa wasinman waturiq richkani, ichapis jaqaypi llamk’arikuyman”- ñispa as
tumpa llakisqa kutichisqa.

“To Cochabamba, I’m going to my sister
Libirata’s house to visit, maybe I’ll work there,” he answered, just a little
sadly.

Libirata sutita

Chayrayku wawitan paqarikuqtaq wilalinta ñuñuykuchiqtaq wañurqapuqtaq. Ni
juknin wawa kawsasqachu.

When he heard Libirata’s name tata Juvenal
thought back and grew sad. It was that when he was much younger, tata Juvenal
had really wanted to marry Libirata. But her father didn’t want them to. It was
said that Libirata had been pregnant from Juvenal three times, but not a single
one lived. “She has poison milk in her breast”, that’s what the people said. So
when she gave birth to a baby, she nursed it and it died. Not a single child
lived.

Tumpata t’ukurispa tata Juvenal,
Faustinuta qhawarispa ajinata ñisqa:

Thinking a little, tata Juvenal looked at
Faustino and said:

-“¡Mikhurinaraq ah
Faustinu! chanta khuskalla risunchik, ñuqapis Quchapampaman risaq”- ñispa
mikhuna wasi ukhuman pusaykusqa.

“Let’s eat, Faustino! then we’ll go together,
I’ll go to Cochabamba too,” he said, taking him into the kitchen.

Chaypi         sumaqta       mikhusqanku,
       tukuy  imaymanamanta     ch’aqwararisqanku.
Chaymantaqa Quchapampaman tata Juvenalpa awtunpi kachaykukusqanku.

They ate well there, and talked about
everything. Then they headed off for Cochabamba in Juvenal’s car.

Tata Juvenal sumaq

Chanta pananpa wasin punkupi saqiytawan utqhayllata ripuyta munasqa.

Tata Juvenal was a wealthy man, he had bought
himself a car. In that car, he went wherever, whenever. He went right to where
Libirata lived.   That day he took
Faustino straight to his sister’s house. Libirata’s house was in Republica. He tried to leave
quickly  after leaving him at his
sister’s door.

-“Pachi Juvenal. Manachus
qam, ¿imanaymantaq karqa? tinkunakama kachun”- ñispa Faustinu Juvenalpa makinta
q’apirisqa.

“Thanks Juvenal. If it weren’t for you, what
would have happened? see you later” Faustino said, squeezing Juvenal’s hand.
-“Tinkunakama”- ñiytawan
tata Juvenalqa awtunman wasarispa q’usñi jatariyta chinkaykakapusqa.

“See you later,” tata Juvenal said, and he
disappeared with a cloud of smoke coming out of his car.

Sumaq kusisqa Faustinu
punkuta takaykusqa, mana ni pitaq lluqsimusqachu. Ni pi lluqsimuptinqa, wasi
punkupi punchunta mast’aykukuytawan, chukuykuspa kukata pikchiyaspa suyasqa.

A very happy Faustino knocked on the door, but
no one came out. When no one came, he covered the doorstep with his poncho, sat
down, and chewed coca while waiting.

-“¿Mana Juvenal
apamuwanman karqa chayri? ¿Imaynatataq chayamuyman karqari? kunan, kunantaqa
chakillapiraq jamuchkayman karqa, chantari ¿imaynatataq panaypaq wasinta
mask’ayman karqa? ¿mana tariyman karqa chayri? Yaku ch’akiymantapis wañuymanchá
karqa ah”- ñispa unayta t’ukurisqa.

“If Juvenal hadn’t brought me here, then what?
How would I have gotten here? I would still be walking now if I had come on
foot, and how would I have found my sister’s house? What if I hadn’t been able
to find it? I might have died of thirst,” he said to himself, thinking for
awhile.

Libirata chay jatun

Libirata lived alone in that big house. She
wasn’t married. Every night she sold roasted tripe in the Pulakayu market. She made money doing just that. Libirata lived
well by herself in Cochabamba. She didn’t go back to Kalallusta often, since everyone there would stare at her because
she hadn’t married tata Juvenal.

Chay p’unchawqa Faustinu
t’ukurayachkaptillan Libirata qhatumanta jatun q’ipiyuq chayamusqa.

While Faustino was sitting around thinking
that day, Libirata arrived from the market with a big load.

-“¡Faustinu! ¿Imata kaypi
ruwachkanki?”- ñispa tapusqa.

“Faustino! What are you doing here?” she
asked.

-“¡Panay! ñuqa ancha

wasiykipi juk k’uchituta puñunaypaq quriway ari, chantapis llamk’ayta taripayta

“My sister! I’m so sad, I came to Cochabamba
to make money. Sister, give me a little corner in your house to sleep, and help
me find work,” Faustino said to his sister.

-“Ama llakikuychu turay
ñuqa panaykichá kani ari, wasiypi karikullanki, ñuqa juk chuwa mikhunitatapis
jaywarillasqayki”- ñispa panan kutichisqa.

“Don’t be sad my brother, aren’t I your
sister? Stay in my house, and I’ll bring you a plate of food,” his sister
answered.

Chay p’unchawmanta

Killa tukukuypaqqa pachak kimsa chunkayuqtajina ruwakusqa.
From that day on, Libirata took her brother to
the market, where there was money to be made carrying things on his back. Then
Faustino went by himself on foot to the Cochabamba market everyday. Every day
he made about 5 bolivianos. At the end of the month, he had made about 130.

Tata Faustinuqa achkha

After making so much money, tata Faustino was
really happy. One Thursday he went to the market to shop.  That day he bought: some potato seeds,
carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, rice, bananas, oranges and some sweets for
his children.

Q’ayantin p’unchawqa

The next day was Friday. A truck went from
Cochabamba to Anzaldo every Friday,
there weren’t trucks the other days. That day, Faustino loaded everything he
had bought into the truck and went back to Anzaldo.

From Anzaldo
he rented a donkey and arrived happily on foot in his town of Kalallusta. He carried everything, and
he also had 60 Bolivianos. Once he arrived, everyone was very happy. They got
even happier when they saw everything that he had brought. Faustino, Francisca
and the children enjoyed the bananas and oranges. When her husband gave her the
money, Mama Francisca kissed Faustion’s hand with happiness.

Chay p’unchawmantaqa, may

From that day, they were very happy, they
planted potatoes in mounds in the ground. Now there was money for food. They
ate bananas once a month. When the money had dwindled, Faustion headed back to
Cochabamba. He earned money working for a month, then went back home to Kalallusta for two months.

Juk p’unchaw qullqi pisiyaptin,
-“Quchapampaman kutisaq”- ñisqa Faustinu.

One day when there wasn’t much money, Faustino
said “I’m going back to Cochabamba”.

-“Guillermitu jaku
Quchapampaman, qampis qullqita ruwakamunki”- ñisqa kuraq wawanta.

“Guillermo, let’s go to Cochabamba, you’ll
also make money there,” he said to his oldest child.

-“¡Ama pusapuwaychu!,
¿imaynata pay qullqi ruwanqa? ¡uña waynuchullaraqqa!”- ñispa mamanqa wawanmanta
jark’akusqa.

“Don’t take him from me! what money will he
make? he still just a young boy!” his mother said, blocking him from her child.

Guillermo was just seventeen years old. He
didn’t know how to do much work yet, he only knew how to take sheep and cows to
graze. He already knew how to play the accordian really well, he made his mom
really happy everytime he played. That day, his father took the young man to
the city anyway.

Guillermota llaqtaman

Juk jatun wiksasapa runa. Q’umir ñawi.

When he had brought Guillermo to town, a
friend of his sister Libirata’s, Mario, was there. He had a big belly. Green
eyes.

-“Kay wawayki ñuqata

ñispa Marioqa Faustinutawan Libiratatawan tapusqa.

“Your child could help me get the cows onto
the truck. He knows how to take care of animals, right?” Mario asked Faustino
and Libirata.

-“Arí, Guillermitoqa
sumaqta wakata michin, kusatachá qamwan llamk’anman”- ñispa tatanqa kutichisqa.

“Yes, Guillermo herds cows well, he should do
a good job working with you,” his father replied.

Mario was a cow seller. He bought cows from Tarata, Cliza, Arani, Punata, Tiraque,
Aiquile and some other places and brought them to Cochabamba to sell. Mario
made a lot of money selling cows. He bought cows cheap, and then sold them at Cow Beach, as they called it, in
Cochabamba for a lot more. Guillermo worked for three whole months with Mario.
He went everywhere with Mario, looking for cows to buy.

One day they bought four bulls in Aiquile and were taking them to
Cochabamba. Guillermo was riding on top of the truck with the cows. The road
from Aiquile to Cochabamba was as
scary as could be. Right before they got to a narrow curve, a big truck
appeared. That truck was zig-zagging along. The driver of this big truck was
pretty drunk. Tata Mario turned to the right, and the big truck did the same,
Mario turned back to the left, hard, and all at once they flipped right over.

-¡Way!- ñispa sinchita
Guillermituqa qhaparisqa.

“Ahh!” Guillermo cried out.

Awtuqa millayta wakantin

On that curve, the truck and all the cows
flipped over horribly. The cows were thrown to the ground and crushed Guillermo
almost to death. Mario was alright, when he got up he didn’t know what to do.
He walked over to Guillermo, and he could barely recognize the child. The young
man’s head was covered in blood. His hands and feet were broken. Mario saw this
and got very frightened, he couldn’t do anything and started to cry.

-“¡Yanapariwaychik!
¡Yanapariwanchik!”- ñispa sinchita waqaririspa qhaparikusqa.

“Help us! Help us!” he called out, crying.

A small yellow car was coming to Cochabamba
from Cliza. That car saw Mario and
stopped to help. They wrapped the child in a blanket and put him into the
yellow car. They left the cows and the truck as they were, and set off for the
hospital in the yellow car. He thought in his head: “Guillermo could still get
better”. As they were going down the road, the child was still breathing
weakly. They got to Cochabamba and he turned cold. Mario got more scared. They
went into the hospital and the doctors looked at the child:

-“Wañusqaña kay wawaqa”-
ñisqankutaq

“The child is already dead,” they said.

Marioqa ni imanakuyta

Mario couldn’t do anything, he punched the
wall, he couldn’t stop the tears from falling from his eyes.

The doctors grabbed Mario and took him to a
cold room where they tended to his wounded face. After being taken care of, he
left the hospital quickly and went to Libirata’s house to look for Faustino.

Faustino had started drinking chicha a month
ago. At the end of every week, he drank chicha all night with various cholas.
He hadn’t even gotten back to Libirata’s house yet. He had forgotten all about Kalallusta. How mama Francisca survived
with two young children, no one knows! Mama Francisca went around for a long
time saying “Guillermo and his father will come back soon”. His mother had bad
dreams about Guillermo every night.

Chay p’unchawqa Marioqa jampina

Mario walked from the hospital to Libirata’s
house that day.

-“Tata Faustinuta mask’achkani,

“I’m looking for tata Faustino, I have bad
news to tell him,” he said to Libirata.

-“Iskay p’unchawña mana

“He hasn’t come back for two days now, he’s in
some chicería somewhere. What bad news do you have to tell him? Don’t make me
worry, what is it?” she asked him, afraid.

-“¡Ay! ¡Mama Libiratay!
Paqarin Guillermituwan wakantin awtupi tikrarparikuyku”- ñispa tata Mario
sinchimanta waqarikusqa.

“Oh, mama Libirata! this morning the truck
flipped over with Guillermo and the cows,” tata Mario said, crying.

-“¡Tatituy ñiñituy!
¿Maytaq kunan Guillermituri?”- ñispa mama Libirata astawan mancharikusqa.

“My God! and where is Guillermo now?” mama
Libirata said, terrified.

-“Jampina wasipi wañusqa

“He is lying dead in the hospital,” Mario
said, starting to sob.

-“¡Irpita! ¿Kunan

churakullasqataq.

“O my poor little angel! And now what will we

cry.

-“Chayta willayta

“I wanted to tell him, where could I find his
father now?” Mario said, drying his tears from his eyes with his handkerchief.

-“¡San Antonio aqha

mask’aq kachaykukusqanku.

“He’s probably in the San Antonio chichería.
Let’s go find him right now!” she said to Faustino, and they set off to look
for him.

Jinamanta Libiratawan

Libirata and Mario went to San Antonio to look for Faustino. There
were many chicherías in San Antonio,
they went into them one by one and asked, but they didn’t find anything. They
headed to the San Sebastian area.
There was a big chicería there, they went in and Faustino was drinking chicha
there with a big chola and two other men.

-“¿Aqha upyanallata qam
yuyanki ih? ¿Maypitaq kay iskay p’unchaw karqanki? ¿Imaptintaq mana
wasillamanpis chayamunkichu? Guillermitupis wañusqa jampina wasipi

“Do you only remember how to drink chicha?
Where have you been these two days? Why haven’t you come home? Guillermo died
and is lying in the hospital,” Libirata said, speaking very angrily to her
brother.

Chayta uyariytawanqa tata
Faustinu sinchita mancharikusqa, jukllata -“¡p’uqun!”- ñispa pampaman

Faustino heard this and got scared, then
suddenly he cried out and fell to the floor.

-“¡Imanantaq!
¿Imanakuchkantaq?”- ñispa chay jatun warmi piwanchus aqhata upyachkasqa chayqa

“What?! What’s happening?” the big woman he
had been drinking with cried out.

rikch’arisqa.

Everyone drinking in the chichería gathered
around. They poured water on him, but he still didn’t wake up. Then they blew
on him just a little, and he woke up with difficulty.

-“¿Imanantaq?”- ñispa Faustinu
rikch’ariytawankama tapukusqa.

“What happened?” Faustino asked once he woke
up.
-“Guillermitu wañusqa jampina

“Little Guillermo is dead in the hospital,”
Mario said sadly.

-“Qam wañuchinki ¡karaju!
¿Imanapuwankitaq wawayta?”- ñispa Mariota maqayta munasqa.

“You killed him, you jerk! What did you do to
my child?” he said, trying to hit Mario.

-“Ama jinaychu”- ñispa wakinqa

“It’s not like that” the other said,
protecting himself.

Then Libirita and Mario told Faustino all
about Guillermo. Suddenly Faustino burst into tears, then he set out for the
hospital with his sister. Mario went to see about his cows and truck.

Jampina wasipiqa mana

Ajinata jurqhuyta atinkuman kasqa. Jinapi aya tawa-k’uchutapis Libirata

At the hospital, they didn’t want to take the
body out. They had to bring a coffin, they said. That’s how they should take it
out. So Libirata bought a coffin, Faustino didn’t have a single dime because he
had spent his money drinking chicha.

Marioqa ayata Anzaldo chiruman, Kalallusta
llaqtanman apapuyta munasqapis.

Mario wanted to bring the body from Anzaldo to Kalallusta.

-“Juk tutalla trankata

“I’ll take you through the roadblocks in the
night” he said.

Faustinu mana munasqachu.

Faustino didn’t want to.

-“Quchapampallapi

“Let’s just bury him in Cochabamba,” he said.

Jinamanta chay
ch’isi-pacha ayata Quchapampapi Libiratap wasinpi wilasqanku. Q’ayantinpachataq

So that night they had a vigil over the body
in Libirata’s house in Cochabamba. And the next day they burried Guillermo in
Cochabamba.

Mama Fransiska
Guillermitun wañupusqanta mana yachallasqapischu. Faustinu mana willayta

Mama Francisca still didn’t know about her
little Guillermo’s death. Faustino didn’t want to tell her, and he didn’t want
to take Guillermo’s body to Kalallusta
to be buried either.

Chaymantaqa, Libirataqa turanta
ajinata ñisqa:

At some point, Libirata said to her brother:
-“Mama Fransiska
imaynachus kakuchkanpis, wawantaqa p’ampakuqtaqa mana rikullanpischu.
¿Imaptintaq mana riytawan pusarqamurqankichuri? Kunanqa, ¿Imaynatataq

“And what about mama Francisca, she didn’t
even see her child buried. Why didn’t you go and get her? Now, what are you
going to tell her?”

-“Kunan-pacha Kalallustaman kachaykukusaq, kay
Guillermitup p’achanta apakapusaq, chaypi mamanman willasaq”- ñispa Faustinu
kutichispa kachaykukusqa.

“I’m going to Kalallusta right now, I’ll take Guillermo’s clothes, I’ll tell his
mother there,” Faustino answered and headed out.

Anzaldo man chayaytawanqa

When he got to Anzaldo, he spent the night drinking chicha. The next morning he
got to Kalallusta. He went into the
house. As soon as Luwisa saw her father she said:

-“¡Tatay! ¿Misk’ita,
latanuta, laranjata apamurqankichu?”- ñispa payman utqhayta chimpaykusqa.

“Father! Did you bring sweets, oranges and
bananas?” she said, rushing over to him.

-“¡Mana ni imata

Luwisataqa qhaparisqa.

“I didn’t bring anything! I didn’t make any
money,” he yelled at Luwisa, still a little drunk.
Luwisaqa chayta uyariytawanqa

Luwisa heard this and started crying with
heartfelt pain on the back of the door.

Chaymantaqa wayk’una

Then he went into the kitchen. There, mama
Francisca was giving his young son Fortunato mote water to drink, very sad.

-“¿Imaptintaq ajinata

“Why did you just leave us like that? where

Silently, he looked at his wife, she was
holding the young child in her arms. He kept looking at her, mama Francisca’s
clothes were worn out and torn. Her sandals too were broken in parts, and she
couldn’t walk well anymore.

-“Guillermito awtupi tikrakuspa
wañupun”- ñispa Faustinu willarisqa.

“The truck flipped over and Guillermo died,”
Faustino told her.

-“¿Ja?”- ñispa Fransiska sinchita
qhaparisqa.

“What?!” Francisca cried out.
-“Ñiykijina Guillermitu
awtu tikraypi wañupun, qayna Quchapampapi p’amparqayku”- ñisqa yapasqa.

“I’m telling you that Guillermo died in an
accident, we buried him yesterday in Cochabamba,” he added.

Chayta uyariytawanqa mama
Fransiska sinchita sunqu nanayta waqaq churakusqa. Inti yaykuytapis

When mama Francisca heard this she started to
cry with the pain of her whole heart. When the sun came up she was still
crying. Nothing quieted her sorrow.

-“¿Imamanta waqachkanki
mamay?”- ñispa Luwisaqa ch’ichi uyita-pacha mamanta tapurisqa.

“What are you crying about mama?” Luwisa asked
her mother, with a dirty face.

-“Umay nanachkawan wawitay”- ñispa
wawanta uqllaykuytawan waqallasqapuni.

“I have a headache, my little child” she said
to her child, she hugged her and kept crying.

Chay p’unchawqa mana ni

The didn’t even cook that day. They didn’t
take the animals to pasture either. When the sun went down she was still
sitting in the kitchen crying. Then, they ate some sour boiled corn and went to
bed. That night, mama Francisca was too sad to sleep.
Q’ayantinqa Faustinu ñisqa:

The next day Faustino said:

-“Wawanchiqqa, sumaq k’acha tawa-k’uchupi p’ampasqa. Aya
pampapis jaqay Quchapampa llaqtapiqa k’achitu kasqa. Achkha t’ika ukhullapi

“Our child, he was buried in a beautiful
coffin. The cemetery in Cochabamba is also beautiful. We buried our child in
the middle of a lot of flowers.”

Chayta qusanpa siminmanta

When she heard this from her husband’s mouth,
there was a little happiness in mama Francisca’s heart.

Nine days later, they had a mass in Anzaldo. At dawn, they prepared a lunch,
then they all went to hear the mass in Anzaldo.
Lots of people from Kalallusta also
came to the mass. When mass finished, everyone went out dressed in black. That
day, they went back to Faustino’s house and ate and got drunk on chicha.

A week after that, everyone in Kalallusta prepared the ground to plant
the potatoes. That year Faustino’s family planted potatoes in four different
places. As soon as the potato mounds were built, Faustino said:

-“Quchapampaman kutinay

“I have to go back to Cochabamba. Our two
children have to live well. Nothing else bad can happen to us anymore, we have
already lost two male children. From this point on, I’m going to work hard.
Every month I’m going to come back, and I’ll bring food,” he said, and again he
set off by himself to go back to Cochabamba.

From that time, he worked very hard, just like
he said he would. He bought a pair of cows. Now, Francisca and the children
drank milk some mornings. They lived really well.

Tata Faustino was still coming to Cochabamba
to make money. He came at the beginning of every month, and at the end of the
month he took the money and food and went back very happy.

At the school, they gave milk and a piece of
bread to the students every day. Because of this, all the students took an
empty jug when they went to school. Tata Waltiku and mama Guadelupe’s children
also went to the school.

Every morning, Luwisa and Fortunato always
went to school together. Their mother took the sheep to pasture. Mama
Francisca’s sheep were very fertile. Once a year, they slaughtered a sheep and
they ate very well.

When tata Faustino wasn’t in Cochabamba, he
carved excellent ladles out of wood. He could also make great plows. On
Fridays, Mama Francisca sold the ladles and plows that he made in Anzaldo.

He wasn’t staying in Libirata’s house in
Cochabamba anymore. He lived in a little house at the corner of República and Punata. Lots of people slept there every night. Every two nights
they gave a boliviano to the owner for sleeping there.

Everyday, Faustino and some other men he
didn’t know worked carrying all sorts of things on their backs. On Sundays,
they went to Rio Rocha to wash their
clothes. One Sunday, they were coming back from the river and they went into a
chichería. There, they got Faustino drunk again, he didn’t want to. He drank
chicha that night until dawn. Faustino blew all the money he had made on chicha
that night. The next morning he was sad:

-“¿Kunan ima qullqitataq Kalallustaman apasaqri? ¿Imaynallatataq
mana qullqiyuq chayasaqri?”- ñispa ukhunpi t’ukurispa llakirikusqa.

“Now what money will I take to Kalallusta? And how can I arrive with no
money?” he said to himself, worried.

Chay killa tukukuytaqa

Fransiska llakisqalla qhipakusqa.

He didn’t go back to Kalallusta at the end of that month. Mama Francisca was left to
worry.

-“¿Aqha uqunamanchu

t’ukuspalla puriykachaq kasqa.

“Is he giving himself again to gulping chicha?
Why doesn’t my husband come back with some money?” she thought, pacing back and
forth.

From that day on, Faustino worked and then
went straight back to chichería. He didn’t go back to Kalallusta anymore. He was in the chichería everyday now. He worked
from the early morning, ate and then everyday went to the chicería. There, he
drank with many men and women.

Mama Francisca couldn’t plant potatoes, corn
or wheat by herself anymore. She didn’t have any money, and sold a sheep every
two months, and with just that they lived poorly. Their store of potatoes,
wheat and corn were about to run out. She couldn’t do anything, every day was a
struggle.

Juk ch’askachaw p’unchaw

One Friday mama Francisca wanted to go to
Cochabamba to look for her husband. There was a truck that went from Anzaldo to Cochabamba every Friday
evening. Mama Francisca knew this, so she went to tata Waltiku’s house and
asked for their help:

-“Tata Waltiku mama
Wadalupi, qamkuna yachankichik Faustinu unayña mana chayamusqanta. Ama jinachu

“Tata Waltiku and mama Guadalupe, you know
that Faustino hasn’t come here for a long time now. Please, I’m going to
Cochabamba to look for him. My Luwisa and Fortunato are staying by themselves.
They could stay with you at your house. Just three nights; Friday, Saturday and
Sunday. Could you help out with my animals? Just three days you could take them
to pasture, yes?”

-“Ama llakikuychu
Fransiska, wawakunaqa ñuqaykuwan kakullanqanku. Uywakunatapis ñuqayku
michillasqayku. Qamqa riy qusaykita mask’amuy”- ñispa tata Waltiku ñisqa.

“Don’t worry Fransisca, the children will be
with us. And we’ll take your animals to pasture. Go on and look for your
husband,” tata Waltiku said.

-“Pachi, jina kaptinqa
kunan sukhayayta-pacha Quchapampaman kachaykukusaq”- ñisqa Fransiskaqa.

“Thanks, that’s what I’ll do, I’ll leave for
Cochabamba in the evening,” Francisca said.

With Luwisa and Fortunato left at tata
Waltiku’s house, the animals being taken care of, mama Francisca took a little
corn and boiled potatoes for herself. She carried three bolivianos to go in the
truck as well. That Friday at dusk she wrapped up her bundle and went to Anzaldo on foot. When she arrived, the
truck to Cochabamba was already leaving. She climbed into the car quickly.
That’s how she got to Cochabamba. From the truck in Cochabamba she didn’t have
anywhere to go. She asked the driver:

-“¿Maypitaq mama Libirata tiyakun,
mana rikuwaq?”-

“Where does Libirata live, might you know?”

-“Manapuni rikunichu”- ñispa
awtuyuqqa kutichisqa.

“I really don’t know,” the driver answered.

-“Awtu mayniqpichus

chay ñanninta kachaykukusqa.

“From where the car is, walk straight down and
there is a circle, Libirata’s house is across from there, Faustino said that
one day,” she thought, and set off in that direction.

Unaytaña purisqa

She walked a long time and then she didn’t
know where she was. The sun had gone down, and she couldn’t do anything. She
didn’t know where she had walked to. She asked, and no one knew Libirata’s
house. She kept walking and walking and got to the train station. There were
lots of people sleeping there at night. She went up to them and covered a
corner with her scarf, sadly ate the corn and boiled potatoes she had brought,
and then sat down there in the corner and went right to sleep.

When she got up the next day at the crack of

got up and didn’t know where to go.

She walked around Cochabamba alone that day.
She looked around, asking about her husband, but didn’t find him. She got to
the market, some women were selling food and others were eating. Mama Francisca
didn’t have a cent. She was about to die of hunger and thirst. She just kept
walking, sadly looking at the people in the market. As she was walking, she was
very sorry she had come to Cochabamba.

She walked and kept asking, but she didn’t
find anyone who knew. And then the sun went down again, and she was right in Pulakayo, Barrientos. She just slightly
recognized where she had gotten to.

“That’s it, I’m going back to Kalallusta!” she said in her head, she
went to the road that went to Cliza,
and she set off on foot, asking along the way whether she was going in the
right direction.

-“¿Imata kaypi qam
ruwachkankiri?”- ñispa wasanmanta uyarisqa.

“What are you doing here?” she heard from
behind her.

Mama Fransiska sumaq
mancharisqa wasanta qhawarikusqa, chaypitaq Faustinu tumpa machasqa, k’uyunata
pitarichkasqa.

Mama Francisca looked behind her, afraid, and
there was Faustino, a little drunk, smoking a cigarette.

-“¿Imaptintaq mana
chayamunkichuri? ¿Maypi chinkanki?”- ñispa mama Fransiska qusanman parlasqa.

“Why haven’t you come back? Where did you
disappear to?” mama Francisca said to her husband.

-“Mana chinkanichu,
kutisaqpuni ah, ¿Imaynataq wawakuna kachkanku? ¿Maytaq? Ichamá ima pasan”-
ñisparaq phiñarisqa tapusqa Faustinu.

“I didn’t disappear, I’m still coming back,
yea. How are the kids? And where are they? Did something happen?” Faustino
asked, getting annoyed.

-“Paykunaqa waliq
kakuchkanku, tata Waltikuwan qhipakunku”- ñispataq warmiqa kutichisqa.

“They’re fine, they are staying with tata
Waltiku,” the woman answered.

-“Allin pacha, Jaku
Libiratap wasinman, chaypi imallatapis yanapamunki ah”- ñisqa qusanqa.

“Good, let’s go to Libirata’s house, you can
help with things there,” her husband said.

-“¿Maypitaq tiyakunri?
kay p’unchawnintinta mask’ani, mana wasinta tarinichu”- ñisqa Fransiskaqa.

“And where does she live? I’ve been looking
all day long, I didn’t find her house,” Francisca said.

-“Jaqay chimpapi ari.
Jaqay yuraq wasi rikhurimuchkanchari, chaymanta paña chirunpi”- ñispa, Faustinu
makinwan rikuchisqa.

“Over there. You can see that white house,
right? from there it’s to the right,” Faustino said, pointing.

Chay p’unchawqa Libiratap
wasinman ripusqanku. Mikhuykuytawankamaqa unayta ch’aqwasqanku. Libirata
Faustinup kuraqninjina sumaqta sullk’a turantaqa k’amirisqa.

They
went to Libirata’s house that night. When they were done eating, they talked
for a long time. Libirata was older than Faustino, and she scolded her little
brother harshly.

-“¿Maytaq qullqi? Jayway
kay warmiman, ¿Wawakuna imatataq mikhunqanku?”- ñisqa sumaqninta turanta
rimasqa.

“And where’s the money? Give it to this women,
what are the kids going to eat?” she said to her brother.
-“Manaraq jaywawankuchu,
qhasita llamk’achiwanku. Junt’anawanku kachkan”- ñispa alliyllamanta Faustinu
parlarisqa.

“They haven’t given me anything yet, they make
me work for no pay. They need to pay me” Faustino said, quietly.

-“Q’aya warmiykiwan rinki,
chaymantaqa qullqita jaywanki”- kuraq pananqa ñisqa.

“Go tomorrow with your wife, then give her the
money,” his older sister said.

Q’ayantin paqarinqa
mikhuykuytawankama, Faustinu Fransiskata pusarisqa, maypichus llamk’aq chay
chiruman kachaykukusqa. Quchapampa qhatupi unayta puriykachasqanku. Chayllapi
juk runa ñisqa:

The next morning, after eating, Faustino took
Francisca, and they headed off towards where he worked. They walked a long time
all over the Cochabamba market. Suddenly, a man said:

-“¡Yu! ¿Sarata awtumanta
jurayk’achiyta yanapawankimanchu?”-.

“Hey! Could you help me unload some corn from
the car?”

-“Arí, arí”- ñispa utqhayta tata
Faustinu chawpi p’unchawkama yanapasqa.

“Yes, yes” tata Faustino said quickly, and
helped until the middle of the day.

Chay yanapasqanmantaqa
iskay waranqata chay runa Faustinuman jaywasqa, paytaq chay iskay waranqata
mama Fransiskaman jaywasqa. Chaymantaqa qhatu chiruman yaykusqanku. Chaypi
chawpi mikhunata may misk’ita iskayninku mikhuykusqanku, patanpitaq k’isamanta
misk’i yakuta upyasqanku.

That man gave Faustino 2 bolivianos for that
help, and he gave those 2 bolivianos to mama Francisca. Then they went into the
market. There the two of them ate a delicious lunch, and on top of it they
drank dried peach water.

-“¡Kunanqa manuta
quchikampusunchik!”-Faustinu ñisqa.

“Now we’ll go and they’ll pay us what they
owe!” Faustino said.

-“¿Pitaq qhasita
llamk’achisunkiri? ¡jaku rinachik!, jaywapusuchunku wawanchikpaq imallatapis
rantispa apayman”- ñispataq Fransiska yapasqa.

“Who has been making you work for nothing?
let’s go! I’ll take what they give you to buy some things for our children,”
Francisca added.

Jinamanta iskayninku
mikhuykuytawan, qhatu chirumanta wak chiruman, kachaykukusqanku. Chay
p’unchawqa manataq pipis qullqita Faustinuman jaywasqachu. Sinchitaña
purisqankupi sayk’usqankupis.

So then the two of them ate and then went all
around the market, from one end to the other. That day no one paid Faustino.
They were so tired from walking so much.

-“¡Aqhitata upyaykurina!
anchata ch’akiykuchkawan”- ñispa Faustinu warminta aqha wasiman pusaykusqa.

“Let’s drink some chicha! I’m really thirsty,”
Faustino said to his wife and took her to the chichería.

Aqha wasipiqa tukuy
riqsisqa masikunan ch’aqwarispa aqhata upyarichkasqanku. Chayllapitaq,
Faustinuta juk thanta pullirayuq warmitawan rikuytawantaq, t’uku t’ukulla
qhawarisqanku.

At the chichería, everyone he knew was talking
and drinking chicha. At some point, when they saw Faustino with a woman in a
dirty skirt, they looked at him admiringly.

Juk k’uchupiqa achkha
Faustinup riqsisqakunan aqhata upyarichkasqanku. Kimsa qhari, tawa warmi.
Chayllapi juknin warmiqa tapusqa:

A bunch of Faustino’s acquaintances were
drinking in one corner. Three men, four women. One of the women asked:

-“¿Pitaq payri?”-

“Who’s she?”

-“Pay Warmiy ah”- ñispa Faustinu
kutichisqa.

“She’s my wife,” Faustino answered.

-“Warmin kasqa,
¡ajajay!”- ñispa mama Fransiskata qhawarispa juknin chulaqa, tumpa machasqa
asiymanta wañuririsqa, chayta rikuytawan wakinpis asiykukullasqankutaq.

“His wife, he says, hahaha!” one of the cholas
said, looking at mama Francisca, she was dying of laughter, a little drunk, and
then the others starting laughing too.

Mama Fransiska ch’insitullamanta,
mana ni imatapis ñisqataqchu.

Mama Francisca was silent, she didn’t say
anything.

-“Jamuy ah Faustinu ¡aqhitata
upyaykurina ah!”- ñispa juk runa ñisqa.

“Come on Faustino, let’s have some chicha!”
one of the guys said.

-“¡Mana! tata Isikuta
mask’achkani, ¿Mana rikuwaqchik karqa?”- ñispa kutichisqa.

“No! I’m looking for tata Isiku, has anyone
seen him?” he replied.

-“San Antonio aqha wasipi karaykachkarqaqa”- ñispataq juk runa
kutichillasqataq.

“He went off to the San Antonio chichería,” one of the guys answered.

-“Chay Isiku phichqa
chunkata manuchikuwarqa manataq kunankama jaywapuwanchu”- ñisqa Faustinu
sinchimanta parlasqa.

“Isiku owes me 50, he hasn’t paid me up until
now,” Faustino said loudly.

Jinamantataq chay juknin
aqha wasimanñataq kachaykukusqanku. Chay aqha wasiman yaykuptinkukama, Isikuqa
Faustinuta rikuytawan uqllaykuspa jamp’ara chayman pusasqa. Chaypitaq aqhata
jaywasqa pacha. Mama Fransiska juk k’uchupi sapan unayta sayakusqa. Chaypitaq
juk warmi payman qayllaykuytawan tapusqa.

Then they went right on to this other
chichería. When they went into the chichería, Isiku saw Faustino, hugged him
and took him over to the table. There, he immediately offered some chicha. Mama
Francisca waited alone for a while in a corner. There a women went up to her
and asked:

-“¿Imaykitaq qampata Faustinu?”-.

“What are you doing with Faustino?”

-“¡Qusay ari!”- ñispataq
kutichisqa.

“He’s my husband!” she answered.

-“Yachariwaqchus wakcha
warmi. Kay qhariqa sapa p’unchaw aqha wasimanta aqha wasi purikun. May chhika
chulayuq, jukwantaq jukwantaq uqllanarikuspa may kusisqa puriykacharikun. Sapa
p’unchaw munasqanta ruwarikun”- ñiytawan chay warmiqa utqhayta karunchakapusqa.

“If you only knew, humble woman. That man goes
from chichería to chichería everyday. He has lots of cholas, he walks around
really happy, hugging this one and then that one. Everyday he does whatever he
wants.” the woman said this and then rushed off.

Chayta uyariytawan mama
Fransiskap sunqun phirikusqa, qusanta ch’inllamanta qhawarispa, phutiyta waqaq
churakusqa. Tata Faustinutaq warmintaqa ni qhawarimullasqapischu. Manapis
rikunmanchujina Isikuwan aqhata sinchimanta asirispa upyakullasqapuni.

After hearing this, mama Francisca’s heart was
shattered, she watched her husband silently, and then started to cry in
anguish. Tata Faustino didn’t even look at his wife. He was still drinking
chicha and laughing with Isiku, as if he couldn’t see her.

-“¿Imatataq ñuqa upajina
kaypi sayarayachkaniri? Ripusaq kay qharimanta karunchakapusaq. ¡Supay apachun
kay qhinchataqa!”- ñispa waqallasqapuni. Chaymantataq jukllata punkuta
lluqsimuspa Cliza awtu sayan chay
chiruman purimusqa.

“And why am I waiting here like an idiot? I’ll
go off and get away from this man. He can go to hell!” she said, still crying.
Then all of a sudden she went out the door and walked over to where the truck
to Cliza waited.

Cliza  awtu sayan chayman
chayamuspa, makinta qhawarikusqa, iskay waranqa k’ata kasqa. Quchapampamanta Clizakama awtuqa iskay waranqamanta
runata apaq kasqa. Clizamantaqa
chakipi Anzaldo llaqtakama may chhika
runa chakipi puriq kasqanku ñin.

She got to where the truck to Cliza waited, looked at her hand, there
were 2 little pieces. The truck took people for 2 Bolivianos from Cochabamba to
Cliza. From Cliza, a lot of people walked to Anzaldo.

Jinamanta chay awtuman
wasariykusqa. Awtupi Clizaman
kutimuchkaspaqa juk k’uchupi chukuykuytawan manapuni waqasqanmanta ch’inyayta
atisqachu, phutiyta waqallasqapuni. Ñawinpis may punkisqaña kasqa, chay chhika
waqasqanpi q’ala puka pukallaña kasqapis.

So then she got into the truck. She sat in a
corner, and while she was going back to Cliza
in the truck she still couldn’t quiet her tears, she kept crying in distress.
Her eyes had swollen, and had gotten red from so much crying.

Cliza piqa awtumanta
jurq’aytawan, Anzaldo ñanninta
chiqitunta t’ukuspa, waqaspa ni imata ruwayta atispa kachaykurikapuchkasqa.
Ñanninta purichkaspa t’ukuchkallasqapuni. Mana yachasqachu imaptinchus Anzaldoman kutichkasqantapis. Makinta
qhawarikusqa ch’usaq kasqa. Sunqun ukhuqa llakiymanta yawartapis
waqachkanmanjinapuni kachkasqa. Umanpi wawankunata ajinata ñichkaqta rikurispa.

She got out of the truck in Cliza, thought directly of the road to Anzaldo and set out, not being about to
do anything else. She kept thinking as she walked down the road. She didn’t
know how she would get to Anzaldo.
She looked at her hand and it was empty. Her heart felt like it was crying
blood from sadness. In her head she saw her kids saying:

-“Mamay, ¿Imatataq llaqtamanta
aparimurqanki?”-.

“Mama, what did you bring back from the city?”

Chaykunapi t’ukurispa
astawan sunqunqa llakiymanta phirikusqa. Ñawinmantaqa waqay manapuni
ch’akisqachu, paramuchkanmanpisjina surumuchkallasqapuni. P’achanpis waqaymanta

purichkaspalla, mama Fransiska jukllata ñan chawpipi sayarpariytawan Cliza chiruman qhawarimusqa. Umanpi
imapis ¡kutiripuy Clizaman! ñiqtajina
uyarisqa.

Her heart shattered even more from sadness as
she thought about these things. The tears hadn’t dried from her eyes yet, they
kept falling down as if it was raining. Her clothes were soaked with tears too.
As she walked on towards Anzaldo, in
the middle of the road mama Francisca suddenly perked up and looked towards Cliza. In her head she thought “I should just go back to Cliza!”.
