Acknowledgments

It is a joy for me to be able to acknowledge all the people and institutions who
have helped me in the course of this project. I owe thanks, first, to Willem Ade-
laar, who read the manuscript with extraordinary care and offered me invaluable
comments which saved me from numerous, numerous errors. Many thanks are
due, too, to Rodolfo Cerrón-Palomino for comments and advice, as well as to
Andrés Chirinos Rivera for orientation. Also offering orientation as well as gen-
erous and very enjoyable hospitality were Carmen Escalante Gutiérrez and Ri-
cardo Valderrama Fernández. Paul Heggarty – an intrepid Andean hiker – joined
me in the field in the course of his own research; he also found me much-needed
support to complete this grammar as well as its accompanying lexicon. Three
anonymous reviewers offered extensive, wise comments. Limitations on my time
and abilities kept me from incorporating all the changes they suggested. Selfless
proofreaders also offered advice for which I am very grateful. Teachers and con-
sultants in Yauyos number more than one hundred; they are acknowledged –
insufficiently – in §1.7. In addition to these, there are many, many people in
Yauyos and especially in Viñac who are owed thanks for all manner of help and,
above all, for friendship. Requiring special mention among these are my prin-
cipal teacher, Delfina Chullukuy, my principal translator, Esther Madueño, and
my ñaña and turi Hilda Quispe and Ramón Alvarado.
Thanks go, too, to Elio A. Farina for help with LATEX.
Finally, I honestly don’t know how to express my gratitude to Sebastian Nord-

hoff and Martin Haspelmath, above all for their wisdom and patience.

The fieldwork upon which the grammar and dictionary are based enjoyed the
support of several institutions. I am grateful to San Jose State University which of-
fered support in the form of a faculty development that enabled me to initiate the
project. Support at the conclusion came from the Max Planck Institute for Evo-
lutionary Anthropology; it is thanks to the MPI that I was able to turn a ragged
draft into a publishable manuscript. Finally, I benefited extensively from two Doc-
umenting Endangered Languages fellowships from the National Endowment for
the Humanities and National Science Foundation (FN-50099-11 and FN-501009-
12). Any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed here do

not necessarily reflect those of the National Endowment for the Humanities or
the National Science Foundation.

Errors remain, of course, for which I am entirely responsible.

Notational conventions

Table 1 lists the gloss abbreviations employed and the morphemes to which they
correspond. Unless otherwise noted, all morphemes are common to all dialects.
Throughout, Á indicates alternation between [á] and an accent shift to the fi-
nal syllable. H, I, N, R, and S indicate alternations between [ø] and [h], [i], [n],
[r], and [s], respectively. U indicates alternation between [u] and [a]. Y indi-
cates alternation between [y], [i] and [ø]. PI indicates an alternation between
[pi] and [ø] (unique to the additive enclitic -pis). The first five alternations are
conditioned by environment in all dialects. R indicates alternative realizations of
*/r/ – realized as [r] in all dialects except that of ch, where it is predominantly
realized as [l]. Where two morphemes share the same code (as occurs, for ex-
ample in the case of -pa and -pi, which both indicate both genitive and locative
case) the code is subscripted with a number (i.e., gen1, gen2; loc1, loc2). Where
the same morpheme has two or more functions (as is the case, for example, with
-paq, which indicates ablative, benefactive and purposive cases) the morpheme is
subscripted (i.e., -paq1, -paq2, -paq3). In the body of the text, I do not make use of
thse subscripts. Unless otherwise noted, a morpheme occurs in all five dialects.
Where a morpheme is exclusive to one or more dialects, that is indicated in small
caps in parentheses. Tables 1 and 2 list morpheme codes and their corresponding
morphemes. The former is sorted by morpheme code; the latter, by morpheme.

1 Introduction

Yauyos is a critically endangered Quechuan language spoken in the Peruvian
Andes, in the Province of Yauyos, Department of Lima. The language counts
eight dialects. These are listed below in Table 1.1. At the time I undertook my
research in the area, three of these had already become extinct. The missing di-
alects are those formerly spoken in the north of the province: Alis-Tomas (at),
Huancaya-Vitis (hv) and Laraos (l).1 This grammar, therefore, unfortunately,
covers only the five southern dialects: Apurí-Madeán-Viñac (amv), Azángaro-
Chocos-Huangáscar (ach), Cacra-Hongos (ch), Lincha-Tana (lt) and Liscay-San
Pedro (sp).

The lacuna is highly relevant to any conclusions that might be drawn from this
study and, in particular, to any conclusions that might be drawn with regard to
its significance for the classification of the Quechuan languages, as two of the

1 A ten-day town-to-town search undertaken in the north of the province in January 2010 failed
to turn up any speakers of Yauyos Quechua. Some speakers of the Quechua of neighboring
Huancayo, however, could be found yet.

1 Introduction

missing three – Alis-Tomas (at), Huancaya-Vitis (hv) – were those that, accord-
ing to previous work (Taylor 1994; 2000), most resembled the QII languages of
Central Peru.

The remainder of this introduction begins with a section describing the loca-
tion of the various towns where syq is spoken and the geography of the region
(§1.1). The endangerment of the language is the topic of §1.2. §1.3 catalogs the
previous research on the language. Sections §1.4 and §1.5 follow with a brief dis-
cussion of the internal divisions among the various dialects of Yauyos and then a
slightly longer discussion of the classification of the language. The conventions
employed in this volume are detailed in §1.6. §1.7 supplies information about the
fieldwork on which this study is based. Finally, (§1.8) lists the tables and sections
likely to be of particular interest to students of Andean languages, while §1.9
points to topics where the Yauyos data are potentially relevant to linguists from
other subfields.

1.1 Location

The five dialects of syq are spoken in the ten disctricts: Apurí, Madeán, and
Viñac; Azángaro, Chocos, and Huangáscar; Lincha and Tana; Cacra and Hon-
gos; and San Pedro. The first two sets are located in the valley created by the
Huangáscar River and its principal tributary, the Viñac River, as can be seen on
Map 1.1. The second two are located in the valley created by the Cacra River and
its principal tributaries, the Lincha and Paluche Rivers. The two valleys are sepa-
rated by a chain of rather high and rocky hills. Running from east to west, these
are the cerros Pishqullay, Tinco, Punta Tacana, Ranraorqo, Pishunco, Cochapata,
Yanaorqo, and Shallalli.

No district except San Pedro is located more than one day’s walk from any
other; in the case of San Pedro, it is two.2 The four districts that lie within the
province of Yauyos center at 12°62′S and 75°7′W. The principal towns of all the
districts except Chocos, Huangáscar, and Tana sit at altitudes around 3300 meters,
while those of Chocos, Huangáscar, and Tana sit at just under 3000 meters. The
relevant region can be contained within an area of 40 m2; its highest peak reaches
5055 m.3

2 It is not irrelevant to the explanation of the dialect cleavages that this mountain range seems
to block the movement of brides from one set of districts to another. Until very recently, new-
lywed women generally only moved from one town to another within the same valley.

3 There exists a series of topographical maps prepared and published in 1996 by the U.S. Defense
Mapping Agency. Southern Yauyos is covered on the section labeled Tupe and identified Series
1745, Sheet J632, Edition -1 DMA.

1.2 Endangerment

At the date of this writing, the UNESCO classifies Yauyos as critically endangered.
The 18th edition of Ethnologue (Lewis, Simons & Fennig 2015), however, tags it
as “moribund.” Although, as I see it, there is no real likelihood that any dialect of
Yauyos will ever be revived, it is early yet to declare it moribund. I estimate that
there are about twenty teens who understand the Viñac and San Pedro dialects,
as well as many as 80 adults in their forties and fifties who can still speak it
relatively fluently. Moreover, although its use is now generally restricted to the
discussion of every-day and ritual activities, it is still used frequently among the
oldest speakers.

The 1993 Peru census counted 1,600 speakers, 25% of them over 65 (Chirinos-
Rivera 2001: 121). That census, however, did not distinguish between speak-
ers of Yauyos and speakers of other Quechuan languages who resided in the
province (Chirinos-Rivera, p.c.). This is crucial to the assessment of the data on
the Quechua-speaking population of the north of the province. Although there
are many Quechua-speaking migrants there – principally from Huancayo, the
town with which the north has the most commercial contact – I was unable to
locate any speakers of the dialects indigenous to the area. Further, population

data in the province tend to be exaggerated for several reasons. First, people
who emigrated from the region years or even decades ago remain, nevertheless,
officially resident there for reasons of convenience. Second, death certificates are
often not issued for the deceased. Less than ten years before that survey – still, to
my knowledge, the most recent – electricity had yet to come to the Andean towns
of southern Yauyos and the only physical connections between those towns to
the rest of the world were three 40-kilometer dirt paths that wound their perilous
way 2,000 meters down the canyon. Since that time, the Peruvian government
has installed electricity in the region and widened the perilous dirt paths into per-
ilous dirt roads.4 TelMex and Claro now offer cable television, and buses come
and go on alternate days. In short, the isolation that had previously preserved
the Quechua spoken in the region has been broken and the language now counts,
according to my estimates, fewer than 450 speakers, most over 65, and all but the
most elderly fully bilingual in Spanish.

The drastic reduction in the number of speakers can also be attributed to the
Shining Path. During the 1980’s and early 1990’s, the period during which the
Maoist army terrorized the region, there was a large-scale exodus, particularly
of young people, who ran to escape forced conscription. Many never returned,
remaining principally in the coastal cities of Cañete and Lima. Theirs was the
last generation to learn Quechua to any degree. Currently, there are a few chil-
dren – those who live with their grandmothers or great-grandmothers in the
most isolated hamlets – with a passive knowledge of the language. The youngest
speakers, however, are in their late thirties.

Quechuan as a language family is not currently endangered, and other Que-
chuan languages are well-documented. Estimates of the numbers of Quechuan
speakers range between 8.5 and 10 million, and, although Quechua is being pu-
shed back by Spanish in many areas, the majority dialects of its major varieties
– Ancash, Ayacucho, Bolivian, Cuzco, Ecuadorian5 – are quite viable (Adelaar &
Muysken 2004: 168). Paradoxically, however, the viability of the major varieties
is coming at the expense of the viability of the minor varieties. Adelaar (2008:
14) writes: “If Quechua will survive, its speakers will probably be users of four
of five of the most successful dialects, most of which belong to Quechua IIB and
IIC.” The dialects of southern Yauyos, classified as either qi or qiia, and other
minor Quechuan languages are rapidly disappearing.

4 In the space of just one year, spanning 2012 and 2013, fourteen people died in six separate

accidents in the region when their vehicles fell from the road down the canyon.

5 It is worth noting that much of the diversity internal to these languages is being lost, as one

anonymous reviewer points out.

1.3 Existing documentation

Echerd (1974) and Brougère (1992) supply some socio-linguistic data on Yauyos.
There is also a book of folktales, in Spanish, collected in the region in the 1930’s
and 1940’s: Apuntes para el folklor de Yauyos (Varilla Gallardo 1965). Yauyos is
mentioned in the context of two dialectological studies of Quechua by Torero
(1968; 1974).

With these exceptions, all that is known about Yauyos we owe to the French
researcher Gerald Taylor. Taylor’s PhD dissertation describes the morphology
of Laraos, a northern dialect of Yauyos. This work was republished or excerpted,
sometimes with revisions, in Taylor (1984; 1990; 1994; 1994b). Taylor (1987a) sup-
plements the data on Laraos with data on Huancaya, and Taylor (1990; 2000)
provides a comparison of all seven dialects on the basis of eight grammatical
elements and fifty lexical items. Finally, Taylor (1987b,c; 1991) transcribes and
translates several folktales into Spanish and French.

1.4 The dialects of Yauyos

Yauyos groups together various dialects that, although mutually intelligible, dif-
fer in ways that are relevant both to the classification of Yauyos as well as to
the current paradigm for the classification of the Quechuan languages generally.
That classification is highly contested, and, indeed, has been since the first pro-
posals were suggested in the 1960s (See in particular Landerman 1991).

The Province is located on the border between the two large, contiguous zones
where languages belonging to the two great branches of the Quechua language
family are spoken: the “Quechua I” (Torero) or “Quechua B” (Parker) languages
are spoken to its north; the “Quechua II” or “Quechua A” languages, to its south,
as the map in Figure 1.3 shows.

For reasons detailed in §1.5, the model that divides the Quechuan family tree
into two principal branches doesn’t apply very well to Yauyos, as its different di-
alects manifest different characteristics of both of branches. Yauyos is, of course,
not alone in this, not in the least because the division of the languages into two
branches was, arguably, based on rather arbitrary criteria in the first place (See in
particular Landerman 1991). The significance of Yauyos lies in the fact that it may
represent the “missing link” between the two (See in particular Heggarty 2007).
There exist three proposals in the literature – Taylor (2000); Torero (1974); Lewis,
Simons & Fennig (2015) – with regard to the grouping of the province’s fifteen
districts into dialect bundles. Taylor (2000: 105) counts seven varieties of Yauyos

Quechua, dividing these into two groups along a north-south axis. In the north
are the dialects of Alis/Tomas, Huancaya/Vitis, and Laraos; in the south, those
of Apurí/Chocos/Madeán/Viñac, Azángaro/Huangáscar, Cacra/Hongos, and Lin-
cha/Tana. Taylor classes four of these dialects – the northern dialects of Alis/-
Tomas and Huancaya/Vitis and the southern dialects of Azángaro/Huangáscar
and Cacra/Hongos – as belonging to the qi branch; he classes the remaining
three – Laraos in the north as well as Apurí/Chocos/Madeán/Víñac and Lincha/-
Tana in the south – as belonging to qii. Torero (1974) counted only six dialects,
excluding Azángaro/Huangáscar from the catalogue, classing it independently
among the qi dialects along with with Chincha’s Topará. Ethnologue, like Tay-
lor, includes Azángaro/Huangascar and adds, even, an eighth dialect, that of San
Pedro de Huacarpana, spoken on the Chincha side of the Yauyos-Chincha border.
Ethnologue further differs from Taylor in putting Apurí in a group by itself; and it
differs from both Taylor and Torero in grouping Chocos with Azángaro/Huangás-
car. My research supports Taylor’s grouping of Apurí with Madeán and Viñac;
it also supports Ethnologue’s inclusion of San Pedro de Huacarpana among the
dialects of Yauyos. San Pedro is located immediately to the north-east of Madeán
and Azángaro, at less than a days’ walk’s distance. Although formerly counted
a part of the Department of Lima and the Province of Yauyos, a redrawing of

political boundaries placed San Pedro on the Ica side of the contemporary Ica-
Lima border. During the colonial period, the Province of Yauyos was larger
and included parts of what are now the Provinces of Chincha and Castrovir-
reyna (Huancavelica) Landerman (1991: 1.1.3.2.7). Apurí, like its neighbors Viñac
and Madeán, uses -ni and -y to indicate the first-person singular in the verbal
and substantive paradigms; they also use -rqa and -sa to indicate the past tense
and perfect. The first pair of characteristics set the Madeán/Viñac and Lincha/-
Tana dialects apart from the other three; the second pair of characteristics sets
Madeán/Viñac apart from Lincha/Tana. Chocos, like its neighbors Huangáscar
and Azángaro, uses vowel length to indicate the first-person singular in the ver-
bal and substantive paradigms.

1.5 Classification

Yauyos Quechua was dubbed by Alfredo Torero (1974) a “supralect” and its most
careful student, Gerald Taylor, referred to it as a “mixed” language (Taylor 1990:

2, Taylor 2000: 105). Indeed, the designation of Yauyos as a language may seem,
at first, to be no more than a relic of the first classifications of the Quechuan
languages not by strictly linguistic criteria but, rather, by geographic criteria.
Yauyos is located on the border between the two large, contiguous zones where
the languages of the two different branches of the Quechuan language family
are spoken. qi is spoken immediately to the north, in the Department of Junín
and the north of the Department of Lima; qii, immediately to the south, in the
Departments of Huancavelica and Ayacucho. Yauyos manifests characteristics
of both branches. Take first-person marking. Three dialects, Azángaro-Chocos6-
Huangáscar (ach), Cacra-Hongos (ch), and San Pedro (sp), use the same mark-
ing (vowel length) for the first person in both nominal and verbal paradigms7
and mark the first-person object with -ma. These are the two characteristics
that define a Quechuan language as belonging to the qi (also called Quechua B
or Huaihuash) branch. The other two dialects, Apurí-Madeán-Viñac (amv) and
Lincha-Tana (lt), mark the first person differently in the nominal and verbal
paradigms (with -y and -ni, respectively) and mark first-person object with -wa.
These two dialects, then, sort with the qii (A/Huampuy) languages. Indeed, the
first three are classed as qi (specifically, Central-Huancay) and the other two,
qii (specifically Yunagay-Central) (Cerrón-Palomino 1987: 247). Nevertheless,
the “qi” dialects, ach, ch, and sp, manifest few of the other traits that set the
qi languages apart from the qii languages. They do use ñuqakuna in place of
ñuqayku to form the first person plural exclusive as well as -pa(:)ku to indicate
the plural. Crucially, however, so do both the “qii” syq dialects.8 And none of
the five manifest any other of the principal traits that generally set the qi lan-
guages apart from the rest. None use -naw in place of -Sina to form the com-
parative, -piqta in place of -manta to form the ablative, or -naq in place of -shqa
to form the narrative past; and none except for Cacra uses -r (realized [l]) in
place of -shpa to form same-subject subordinate clauses. Now, the two “qii” syq
dialects manifest several of the traits that set the qiic (Chínchay Meridional) lan-
guages apart from the rest. Like the qiic languages, the amv and lt dialects
use the diminutive -cha, the emphatic -ari, the assertive -puni, and the alterna-
tive conditional -chuwan; the amv dialect additionally uses the alternative con-

6 I am very grateful to Peter Landerman for correcting me with regard to the classification of

Chocos, which I had originally misclassified with Madeán and Viñac.

7 Crucially, though, vowel length is not distinctive anywhere else in the grammar or lexicon
of these dialects. For example, these dialects use the qii -naya, -raya, and -paya, not the
qi -na:, -ra:, and -pa: to mark the desiderative, passive, and continuative, respectively. And
all districts but Cacra use tiya-, not ta:- ‘sit’, again sorting with the qii languages.

8 The ch dialect is unique in using -traw in alternation with both -pi and -pa for the locative.

1.5 Classification

ditional -waq. Crucially, however, the three “qi” syq dialects, too, use three of
these: -cha, -ari and -chuwan. Further, all five share with Ayacucho Q the unique
use of the evidential modifier -ki. None of the five manifest any of the other
defining traits of the qiic languages: none uses -ku to indicate the first-person
plural exclusive or the third-person plural; nor does any use -chka9 to form the
progressive or -nka to form the distributive. Further, none suffered the fusion of
*/tr/ with */ch/ or */sh/ with */s/. (See Cerrón-Palomino (1987: 226–248) on the
defining characteristics of the various Quechuan languages) Rather, the dialects
of Southern Yauyos are mutually intelligible, and they together share character-
istics that set them apart from all the other Quechuan languages. With the single
exception that ch uses the accusative form -Kta in place of -ta, all five dialects
employ the same case system, which includes the unique ablative form -paq and
unique locative -pi. All dialects use the progressive form -ya;10 all employ the
plural -kuna with non-exhaustive meaning; and all employ the same unique sys-
tem of evidential modification (see §6.2.11.4). Further, with a single exception,11
the five dialects are uniform phonologically, all employing a highly conservative
system12 that retains all those phonemes hypothesized by Parker and Cerrón-
Palomino to have been included in the Proto-Quechua (see §2.3). Table 1.2, below,
summarizes this information. Please note that the table presents a somewhat ide-
alized portrait and that the characteristics it posits as belonging exclusively to
qii may sometimes be found in qi languages as well. Exceptions of which I am
aware are signaled in notes to the table.

The case of Azángaro-Chocos-Huangáscar requires particular attention in this
context. Torero (1968: 293, 1974: 28–29) classified Azángaro and Huangáscar as
forming an independent group with Topará (Chavín), placing it among the qi
Huancay languages. Cerrón-Palomino (1987: 236), following Torero, cites five cri-

9 Although all use -chka, unproductively except in sp, to indicate simultaneous action that per-

sists in time.

10 One of many attested reductions from *-yka: (-yka:, -yka, -yga, -ycha:, -yya:, -yya-, -ya:, and
-ya) (Hintz 2011: 213–219, 260–268, 290). I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer for pointing
this out to me.

11 In the ch dialect, as in neighboring Junín, the protomorphemes */r/, */s/, and */h/ are sometimes
realized as [l], [h], and [sh], respectively. I have no explanation for why these alternations
occur in some cases but not in others. Indeed, it may be the case that where ch differs from
the rest of the dialects in that it employs */sh/where they employ */h/, it is the former that
preserves the oriɡinal form.

12 An anonymous reviewer points out that other Quechuan languages, Corongo among them,
for example, are more conservative than Yauyos with respect to some features, including the
preservation of the protoform *ñ in *ñi- ‘say’ and ña:-ña ‘right now’. Sihuas, too, preserves
elements of proto Quechua not found in Yauyos. In contrast, while Yauyos preserves a few
proto-Quechua features not found in either Corongo or Sihuas, it also manifests others that
reflect innovations likely adopted from neighboring QII languages.

Note:

(a) An anonymous reviewer points out that this is not exclusively a feature of qii languages

in that the fusion of */ch/ and */tr/ is attested in Huallaga, a qi variety.

(b) With the exception of -pa(:)ku, where the long vowel distinguishes jtacc from ben-refl.
(c) An anonymous reviewer points out that, although this may originally have been posited to
be a defining characteristic of qii languages, it is, in fact, far from such: -shpa is common
in several QI dialects: in Ancash, it attested in Huaylas; it is attested, also in Pachitea in
Huanuco.

(d) Cacra but not Hongos also uses -r (realized [l]).
(e) An anonymous reviewer points out that while diminutive -cha is less productive in qi than

in qii, it is still is common throughout qi, e. g. Victoria-Vitucha, Cabrito-Kapcha.

(f) Also used in Ayacucho (qii).
(g) Also uses -traw (qi).
(h) An anonymous reviewer points out that ablative -paq is almost certainly derived from
*/-piq/ / */-pik/ via vowel harmony. The former is attested in Huaylas and the latter in
Corongo. The other -pi-initial forms in qi (-pita, -pi:ta, -pikta, -piqta, among others) would
have developed later via suffix amalgamation, similar to the formation of bipartite -manta
in qii (see, e. g. , Hintz & Dávila 2000).

(j) Also occurs in Junín (qi).

teria for grouping Huangáscar with Topará. Both dialects, he writes, use -pa:ku
and -:ri to indicate the plural; both use -shpa in place of -r to form same-subject
subordinate clauses; and both use -tamu to indicate completed action; the two
dialects, further, are alike in using unusual locative and ablative case-marking.
Only three of these claims are accurate. First, Huangáscar, as Taylor (1984) al-
ready indicated, does not use -:ri. Second, Huangáscar and Topará may indeed
both use unusual locative and ablative case marking, but, crucially, they do not
use the same unusual case marking: Huangáscar uses -pa to indicate the locative
while Topará uses -man; Huangáscar uses -paq to indicate the ablative while
Topará uses -pa (C.-P. himself points out these last two facts). Huangáscar does
indeed use -shpa to form subordinate clauses and -tamu to indicate irreversible
change. Crucially, however, so do all the dialects of southern Yauyos. In sum,
there is no basis for grouping Huangáscar with Topará and not with the other
dialects of syq. Torero’s data were never corroborated; indeed, the findings of
Taylor and Landerman, the scholars who have most thoroughly studied Yauyos
before now,13 contradict those of Torero.

syq is not a jumble of dialects that, were it not for geographical accident, would
not be classed together; it is, rather, a unique, largely uniform language. Al-
though I myself do not believe that the current paradigm can be maintained, I
have tried to present the data in a way that remains as neutral as possible with
regard to the question of how the internal diversity within the Quechuan lan-
guage family is best characterized, and, in particular, with regard to the question
of whether or not the various Quechuan languages are helpfully construed as
belonging to one or the other of two branches of a family tree (See in particular
Adelaar 2008). I leave it to other scholars to interpret the data as they see fit.
That said, as long as it is maintained, the current paradigm should be revised to
more accurately reflect the relationships of syq with/to the languages currently
named on the Quechuan family tree as it is currently drawn. That tree groups
nine of the eleven districts of southern Yauyos into five sets, assigning each of
these sets the status of an independent language. Moreover, two of these sets are
actually singletons, as Chocos is listed independent of (Azángaro-)Huangáscar,
to which it is identical, and Apurí is listed independent of Madeán(-Viñac), to
which it is identical. (Cacra-Hongos, the set that would deserve independent
placement, if any did, appears nowhere at all). The fact that all these “languages”
are completely mutually intelligible does not justify this. It further seems un-

13 An anonymous reviewer points out that Martha Hardman, Steve Echerd, Rick Floyd, Conrad
Phelps – in addition to several students from Universidad San Marcos – have given Yauyos ex-
tensive attention, although they may not have added to the storehouse of data on the language.

11

1 Introduction

justified to place the Quechua of single villages on the level of that of whole
nations – Bolivia and Ecuador. I suggest, therefore, that Chocos be joined with
(Azángaro-)Huangáscar, and Apurí with Madeán(-Viñac). The first of these new
triplets, Azángaro-Chocos-Hunagáscar, should be mutated to join the other “lan-
guages” of southern Yauyos, under the category Central Yungay. The four sets
should, further, be collapsed and the resulting set called Southern Yauyos. The
revised (pruned) tree would then be as in Figure 1.4. In the event that it be nec-
essary to honor the internal diversity that would be obscured by this move, note
may simply be made to the fact that this “new” language counts multiple dialects.
In this case, Cacra-Hongos and San Pedro de Huacarpana would have to be listed
among these.14

14 I regret having to list Laraos independently here, as I believe it is possible to make a convincing
argument for its inclusion as a dialect of Southern Yauyos. Nothing in this volume, however,
directly speaks to that question. I plan to address it explicitly in a future paper.

1.6 Presentation

1.6 Presentation

To facilitate comparison with other Quechuan languages, the presentation here
follows the structure of the six Quechua grammars published by the Peruvian
government in 1976. Readers familiar with those grammars will note the obvi-
ous debt this one owes to those: it follows not just their format, but also, in
large part, their analysis. The six 1976 grammars cover the Quechuas of An-
cash, Ayacucho, Cajamarca, Cuzco, Huanca and San Martín. (Parker 1976; Soto
Ruiz 1976a; Quesada Castillo 1976; Cusihuamán Gutiérrez 1976; Cerrón-Palomino
1976a; Coombs, Coombs & Weber 1976). Other published grammars of Que-
chuan languages include Herrero & Lozada (1978) on Bolivian Quechua; Catta
(1994) on Ecuadorian Quechua; Taylor (1994) on Ferreñafe; Weber (1989) on Hual-
laga (Huanuco);15 Cole (1982) on Imbabura; Adelaar (1977) description of Tarma
Quechua and his (1986) morphology of Pacaraos; as well as the surveys and com-
pilations of Cerrón-Palomino (1987); Cerrón-Palomino & Solís-Fonesca (1990),
and Cole, Hermon & Martín (1994).

Words and phrases appearing in italics – like this – are in Quechua. English
and Spanish interpretations appear in single quotation marks – ‘like this’. Inter-
pretations are sometimes given in Spanish – the language I used with my consul-
tants16 – as well as English. Transformations (illustrations of changes indicated
as a result of morphological processes referenced) are indicated with arrows –
like → like_this. Quechua words are broken into component morphemes, like
this: warmi-kuna. It is the morpheme relevant to the topic in focus that is in
bold.

Each section and major subsection begins with an account of the topic under
consideration. Terminal subsections supply more extended discussion and fur-
ther examples, generally about 10, often as many as 30 or even 40. All examples
except those indicated with a dagger are taken from the corpus of recordings
collected during the course of the documentation of the language. Those with a
dagger were elicited. Transcriptions can be checked against the original recor-
dings by downloading the compilation of recordings archived with the corpus,

15 Thanks to an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out. Hintz (2011) supplies a grammar of
aspect and related categories in Quechua, especially South Conchucos Quechua (Ancash).
16 Indeed, all English glosses are my translations from the Spanish glosses my consultants orig-
inally supplied. In most cases, the Spanish translations reflected the syntax and semantics of
the original Quechua. I sacrificed this in preparing the the English glosses that appear here. I
made this choice because the more literal glosses are standard in Andean Spanish – in struc-
tures like the possessive ‘su n de a’ (‘his n of a’) – they would not be standard in any English
dialect of which I am aware.

typing a couple of words from either the example or its gloss into the search bar
and following the recording title and time signature back to the original record-
ing. I am also happy to supply this information. Source titles refer to .eaf files
archived with DoBeS and AILLA. File names include three elements: the place
in which the recording was made, the initials of the principal participant, and
a word or two recalling the principal topic(s). For example, the file Vinac_JC_-
Cure was made in Viñac, has for its principal participant Jesús Centeno and for
its principal topic a curing ceremony. Because of restrictions on file names, no
accents are used. So, Azángaro is rendered “Azangaro” and so on.

Glosses were prepared in accord with the Leipzig glossing rules. For reasons
of space, two deviations from the standard abbreviations were made: “proximal
demonstrative” is not rendered “dem.prox” but “dem.p”; and “distal demonstra-
tive” is not rendered “dem.dist” but “dem.d”. Gloss codes are listed with the
notational conventions at page xi, in the section with that name.

1.7 Fieldwork

The fieldwork upon which this document is based was conducted in June and
July of 2010; January through April 2011; August through December 2011; April
through September 2012; and for a total of 10 months between October 2012 and
July 2014. The second of these trips was funded by a faculty development grant
from San José State University; the third through sixth, by two National Endow-
ment for the Humanities-National Science Foundation Documenting Endangered
Languages fellowships (FN-50099-11 and FN-50109-12).

The corpus counts 206 distinct audio and audio-video recordings. The recor-
dings, totaling over 71 hours, were made in the seven districts of Southern Yauyos
– Apurí, Azángaro, Cacra, Chocos, Hongos, Huangáscar, Lincha, Madeán, and
Viñac – as well as in the district of San Pedro de Huacarpana in Chincha. Recor-
dings include stories, songs, riddles, spontaneous dialogue, personal narrative,
and descriptions of traditional activities, crafts and healing practices. Over 28
hours of recordings were transcribed, translated and glossed. The recordings
as well as the ELAN time-aligned transcriptions and accompanying videos are
archived both at The DoBeS project, housed at the Max Planck Institute in Ni-
jmegen, The Netherlands, and at the Archive of the Indigenous Languages of
Latin America at the University of Texas, Austin, USA. All materials can be ac-
cessed via those institutions’ websites, http://www.mpi.nl/DOBES/ and http://

examples will give the reader a sense of the life that supported and was supported
by the language.

Unicode was used for character encoding; audio and video recordings were
saved in the standard formats – PCM wav 44.1/32 bits, .mpg, and .mpeg; unstruc-
tured texts were saved as plain text; structured texts have XML-based underlying
schemas. Recording equipment includes a Marantz PMD 660 solid state digital
audio recorder (pre-January 2013 recordings); a Roland R-26 solid state audio
recorder; an AudioTechnica 831b cardioid condenser microphone (pre-May 2012
recordings); a Sennheiser MKH 8060 cardioid condenser microphone; and a Ca-
non Vixia HF S100 HD flash memory camcorder. Transcriptions, translations
and glosses were prepared with ELAN; Audacity was used for editing audio re-
cordings; iMovie for video recordings. All work was done on a MacBook Pro (pre-
July 2011 recordings) or MacBook Air (post-July 2011 recordings).

1.8 A note to Quechuanists and typologists

Those already familiar with Quechuan languages will likely be interested in the
tables and sections listed in Tables 1.3 and 1.4 immediately below. These indicate
differences between Southern Yauyos Quechua and other Quechuan languages
as well as differences among the various dialects of syq. The footnotes appearing
in these sections may be of interest as well. Those familiar with the literature on
Quechuan languages will immediately recognize the presentation and analysis
here as very much derivative of much previous work on those languages.

1 Introduction

1.9 Broader interest

Yauyos should be of particular interest to semanticists as well as to students of
language contact. Semanticists may find the language’s unusual evidential sys-
tem of interest, while students of language contact may want to look for evidence
of contact between the districts where Yauyos is spoken – that of Cacra-Hongos
in particular – with the three Aymara-speaking districts in the same region of
the province.

1.9.1 Semantics – evidentials

For typologists and semanticists, Yauyos’ evidential system should be of inter-
est. Evidentials, broadly speaking, are generally said to indicate the type of
the speaker’s source of information. syq, like most other Quechuan languages,
employs a three-term system,17 indicating direct, reportative, and inferred evi-
dence (i.e. the speaker has personal-experience evidence for P, the speaker has
non-personal-experience evidence for P, or the speaker infers P based on either
personal- or non-personal-experience evidence). In syq, the three evidentials are
realized -mI , -shI , and -trI (See Floyd (1999) on Wanka Quechua; Faller (2003) on
Cuzco Quechua). The evidential system of syq is of particular interest because it
employs a second three-term system of evidential modifiers. The evidential sys-
tem of syq thus counts nine members: -mI , -mik, and -miki; -shI , -shik, and -shiki;
and -trI , -trik, and -triki. The -I -ik, and -iki forms are not allomorphs: they re-
ceive different interpretations. §6.2.11 describes this system in detail. (For further
formal analysis, see Shimelman 2012 and Shimelman 2014).

1.9.2 Language contact – Aymara

For students of language contact, it is the contact of Yauyos with Aymara that
should be of particular interest.18 The northern branch of the Aymara family is
situated entirely in the province of Yauyos (Adelaar & Muysken 2004: 173): the
Aymaran languages Kawki and Jaqaru are spoken in the central Yauyos munic-
ipalities of Cachuy, Aysa and Tupe. There are, further, reports dating from the
beginning of the 20th century of other Aymaran-speaking communities in the

17 An anonymous reviewer points out that South Conchucos has a 5-choice evidential system,
and Sihuas a 6-choice system (Hintz & Hintz 2017), while Huallaga has a 4-choice system
(Weber 1989).

18 Contact of Quechuan languages with Spanish, of course, is of interest here, as it is in all Que-

chuan languages.

province (174).19 I was unable to find evidence of any unusual lexical borrowing
in Yauyos, i.e., of words – like (pampa- ‘bury’) – not also attested in other Qu-
echuan languages. That said, the lexicon I assembled includes only 2000 words,
in large part because the vocabulary of the language has been much-reduced, as
is to be expected, given that such reduction is one of the symptoms of extreme
language endangerment. Those more familiar with the Aymaran languages may,
however, still be able to find evidence of calquing or structural influence.

19 On Aymara and the relationship of Quechua and Aymara see, among others, Adelaar with
Muysken (2004: 259–317) and Cerrón-Palomino (1994; 2000). On Jaqaru, see, among others,
Hardman (1966; 1983; 2000).

2 Phonology and morphophonemics

This chapter covers the syllable structure, stress pattern, phonemic inventory,
and morphophonemics of Southern Yauyos Quechua.

2.1 Introduction and summary

The syllable structure, stress pattern, phonemic inventory, and morphophone-
mics of syq are not extraordinary. Indeed, what is most extraordinary about them
is precisely how unextraordinary they are: syq is, phonologically, extraordinarily
conservative,1 with four of its five dialects essentially instantiating the systems
proposed for Proto-Quechua in Landerman (1991), Cerrón-Palomino (1987: ch.4).
All syq dialects retain contrasts between (1) [č] and [ĉ]; (2) [k], [q] and [h]; (3)
[l] and [λ]; (4) [n] and [ň]; and (5) [s] and [š].

(1) While in Ecuador, Columbia, Bolivia, Argentina, the east and south of Peru,
as well as in Sihuas, Ambo-Pasco, Tarma, Wanka, Lambayeque, Chachapoyas and
Cajamarca,2 */ĉ/ underwent deretroflection, syq retains Proto-Quechua forms
like trina ‘female’, trupa ‘tail’, katrka- ‘gnaw’, and qutra ‘lagoon’. In syq, traki
‘foot’ contrasts with chaki ‘dry’.

(2) */q/ was neither velarized nor glottalized in syq (which is not to say that
these processes are the norm). The language retains, for example, the pq forms
qusa ‘husband’, qasa- ‘freeze’, waqa- ‘cry’, aqu ‘sand’, uqu- ‘wet’, wiqaw ‘waist’,
waqra ‘horn’, and atuq ‘fox’. syq thus retains contrasts like those between qiru
‘stick’ and kiru ‘tooth’; qilla ‘lazy’ and killa ‘moon’. */h/ appears in syq, as in pq,
principally word-initially, as in hapi- ‘grab’, hampi- ‘cure’, and haya- ‘be bitter’.
(4) In syq, [ň] did not undergo depalatalization as it did in the Quechuas of Cen-
tral Peru. [ň] figures in the first-person personal pronoun ñuqa as well as in lex-
emes such as ñaka-ri- ‘suffer’, ñaña ‘sister’, ñiti- ‘crush’, ñawsa ‘blind’, and ñañu

1 Other phonologically conservative Quechuan languages include Sihuas, which, like Yauyos,
retains contrasts between */ch/ and */tr/, */ll/ and */l/, as well as */sh/ and */s/. Thanks to an
anonymous reviewer for pointing this out.

2 Thanks to an anonymous reviewer for calling my attention to the final examples here.

2 Phonologyandmorphophonemics

‘thin’. Examples of [n]/[ň] minimal pairs include ana ‘mole’ and aña- ‘scold’;
and na dmy and ña disc.

(5) [š] suffered depalatalization throughout the south. syq, however, retains
Proto-Quechua forms such as shimi ‘mouth’, shunqu ‘heart’, shipash ‘maiden’,
washa ‘back’, ishkay, ‘two’, and mishki ‘sweet’. [s]/[š] minimal pairs include
suqu ‘gray hair’ and shuqu- ‘sip’. One also finds contrasts between the native-
borrowed pairs ashta- ‘move’ and asta ‘until’; and asha- ‘yawn’ and asa- ‘anger’.
None of the dialects includes ejectives or aspirates in its phonemic inventory.
Vowel length is contrastive in the grammars but not the lexicons of the dialects
of Azángaro-Chocos-Huangáscar, Cacra-Hongos and San Pedro. In these dialects,
as in all the qi (qb) languages with the exception of Pacaraos, vowel length marks
the first person in both the nominal (possessive) and verbal paradigms (wasi-: ‘my
house’ and puri-: ‘I walk’). The Cacra-Hongos dialect is unique among the five
in that, there, the protomorpheme */r/ is generally but not uniformly realized
as [l], and word-initial */s/ and */h/ are generally but not uniformly realized as
[h], and [š], respectively.3 The first of these mutations it has in common with
neighboring Junín.

A note on */l/ Cerrón-Palomino – like (Torero 1964), but unlike Parker (1969) –
does not include */l/ in his catalogue of proto-phonemes. He admits, however,
that the status of */l/ is controversial. While it does occur in a small number of
proto-morphemes, and, indeed, both /l/ and /ll/ occur in all of the qi contempo-
rary varieties in Ancash and Huanuco, except for Humalies and Margos (thanks
to an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out), he calls it “Un elemento mar-
ginal y parasitario” (“a marginal and parasitic element”). He admits, however,
that the hypothesis that pq included palatal lateral (/ll/) but not a alveolar lat-
eral (/l/) runs into the problem that the universal tendency is that the presence
of /ll/ depends on the presence of /l/, but not vice versa Cerrón-Palomino (1987:
123). W. Adelaar (p.c.) writes, “In support of the controversial status of */l/ which
runs against the universal tendency that /λ/ presupposes /l/, there is the case of
Amuesha (Yanesha’). This language has a generalized palatal vs. non-palatal op-
position in its consonant inventory, but precisely */l/ is missing (apparently an
areal feature shared with Quechua).” I have postulated an /l/ for syq, as both [λ]

3 W. Adelaar (p.c.) writes that, at least with regard to the examples given here and below, the
“Cacra-Hongos development of */s/ to /h/ is found throughout Junín (with the exception of
Jauja). These dialects also use shamu-, instead of hamu-. The first form […] is typical for
Quechua I, and also for Ecuador and San Martín. shamu- may be older than hamu-,” he writes,
“but the correspondence is largely unpredictable according to dialects.” An anonymous re-
viewer adds that Sihuas retains */s/ in sama- ‘rest’, saru- ‘step on’, sayta- ‘kick’, and sita- ‘hit’,
among others.

22

2.2 Syllablestructureandstresspattern

and [l] appear in more than just a few marginal lexemes. [λ] appears in syq lex-
emes like llaki ‘sadness’, lluqsi- ‘exit’, allin ‘good’, allqu ‘dog’, tullu ‘bone’, ayllu
‘family’, wallqa ‘garland’, and kallpa ‘strength’, among many others. As for [l],
as noted in §2.3, it appears, first, as an allomorph of /r/ in the ch dialect. It also
appears in exclamations like ¡alaláw! ‘how cold!’ and ¡añaláw! ‘how beautiful!’
(which occur in Jaqaru, a neighboring Aymara language, as well Castro 1995),
as well as in onomatopoetic terms like luqluqluqya- ‘make the sound of boiling’.
Finally, crucially, [l] also appears in a non-negligible number of semantically
contentful lexemes, including lapu- ‘slap’, lapcha- ‘touch’, laqatu ‘slug’, lashta
‘snow’, lawka- ‘feed a fire’, layqa- ‘bewitch’, lani ‘penis’, lumba ‘without horns’,
alpaka ‘alpaca’, almi- ‘forge a river’, and alqalli ‘testicle’. [l]/[λ] minimal pairs
can be found in contemporary syq in the ch dialect where [l] is an allomorph
of /r/. These pairs include laki- ‘separate’ and llaki- ‘grieve’; tali- ‘find’ and talli-
‘pour’; lunku ‘sack’ and llunku ‘picky’; and lulu ‘kidney’ and llullu ‘unripe’.

§2.2 treats syllable structure and stress pattern; §2.3, phonemic inventory and

morphophonemics; §2.4, Spanish loan words.

2.2 Syllable structure and stress pattern

Syllable structure in syq, as in other Quechuan languages, is (C)V(C) except in
borrowed words. That is, syllables of the form CCV and VCC are prohibited. One
vowel does not follow another without an intervening consonant, i.e., sequences
of the form VV are prohibited. Only the first syllable of a word may begin with
a vowel (a.pa- ‘bring’; ach.ka ‘a lot’).

As in the overwhelming majority of Quechuan languages, primary stress falls
on the penultimate syllable of a word (compare yanápa-n ‘he helps’ and yanapá-
ya-n ‘he is helping’; awá-rqa ‘he wove’ and awa-rqá-ni ‘I wove’). The first syllable
of a word with more than four syllables generally receives weak stress. There
are two exceptions to this rule. First, in all dialects, exclamations often receive
stress on the ultimate syllable (¡Achachák! ‘What a fright!’ ¡Achachalláw! ‘How
awful!’). Second, in those dialects where vowel length indicates the first person,
stress falls on the ultimate syllable just in case person marking is not followed
by any other suffix (uyari-yá-: ‘I am listening’, ri-rá-: ‘I went’).4

4 It is worth noting that this is phenomenon is far from universal: as an anonymous reviewer
points out, “all of the Ancash Quechua varieties mark first person with vowel length, but stress
never falls on the lengthened syllable in word-final position. The same is true for Huamalies
in western Huanuco. The phenomenon [described here for Yauyos] does hold for Huallaga in
central Huanuco, as described by Weber (1989)”.

23

2 Phonologyandmorphophonemics

2.3 Phonemic inventory and morphophonemics

syq counts three native vowel phonemes: /a/, /i/, and /u/. In words native to syq,
the closed vowels /i/ and /u/ have mid and lax allomorphs [e], [ɪ] and [o], [υ],
respectively. That is, in words native to syq, no member of either of the triples {[i],
[e], [ɪ]} or {[u], [o], [υ]}, is contrastive with any other member of the same triple.
The alternations [i] ~ [e] and [u] ~ [o] are conditioned by environment: the second
member of each pair appears in a syllable including /q/ (/qilla/ ‘lazy’ → [qeλa],
/atuq/ ‘fox’ → [atoq]).5

Vowel length is contrastive in the morphologies but not the lexicons of the
dialects of ach, ch and sp. In these dialects – as in all the qi (qb) languages
with the exception of Pacaraos – vowel length marks the first person in both the
substantive (possessive) and verbal paradigms (wawa-: ‘my house’ and puri-: ‘I
walk’ (rendered ‘wawa-y’ and puri-ni in the amv and lt dialects))6.

In all dialects, the consonant inventory counts seventeen native and six bor-
rowed phonemes. The native phonemes include voiceless plosives /p/, /t/, /ch/,
/tr/, /k/ and /q/; voiceless fricatives /s/, /sh/ and /h/; nasals /m/, /n/ and /ñ/; lat-
erals /l/ and /ll/; tap /r/; and approximants /w/ and /y/. Borrowed from Span-
ish are voiced plosives /b/, /d/ and /ɡ/;7 voiceless fricative /f/; voiced fricative
/v/; and trill /rr/. In the Cacra-Hongos dialect, the protomorpheme */r/ is gen-
erally but not uniformly realized as [l] (*runa > luna ‘person’, *ri-y > li-y ‘go!’,
*harka- > halka- ‘herd’), and word-initial */s/ and */h/ are generally but not uni-
formly realized as [h]8 and [ʃ] (*sapa > hapa ‘alone’, *surqu- > hurqu- ‘take out’,

5 An anonymous reviewer points out that “the most complete grammars of Quechuan languages
show several lexemes with mid vowels that are not conditioned by /q/. See, for example, the
discussions in Cusihuamán Gutiérrez (1976: 46–51) on Cuzco and in Swisshelm (1972: xiv–xv)
on Ancash. Similar mid vowel data are found in Ayacucho, Santiago del Estero, Cajamarca,
San Martin, Huallaga, and Corongo, among others. It would be surprising (and noteworthy!) if
SYQ has no such lexemes, in contrast to other Quechuan languages across the family.” I cannot
at this point confirm either that Yauyos does or does not have such lexemes.

6 It is worth noting that in some qi varieties – Huaylas, South Conchucos and Huamalies among
them – lengthened high vowels lower to mid vowels, e. g. , /wayi-:/ [waye:], /puri-:/ [pure:].
Thanks to an anonymous reviwer for pointing this out.

7 In syq, */p/ */t/ and */k/ were not sonorized. syq retains pq forms like wampu ‘boat’ and shimpa
‘braid’; inti ‘sun’ and anta ‘copper-colored’; and punki ‘swell’ and punku ‘door, entryway’.
8 This is hardly unique to Yauyos, occurring in notably in the lects of Yauyos’ immediate neigh-
bor to the north, Junín. In ch, as in the qb lects generally, many stems retain initial /s/: supay
‘phantom’, sipi ‘root’, siki ‘behind’, supi ‘fart’, suwa- ‘to rob’, sinqa ‘nose’, sasa ‘hard’, and siqna
‘wrinkle’. ch also shares with Junín the mutation of r to l. ch patterns with Huanca with regard
to all but one of the phonological innovations common to the lects of other qb regions. For
example, ch and Huanca retain ñ and ll, ch and tr.

clude: saru- > haru- ‘trample’, sara > hara ‘corn’, siqa- > hiqa- ‘go up’, sira- > hila-
‘sew’, sama > hama ‘rest’. Examples of native and borrowed lexemes that resist
these mutations include riqsi- ‘become acquainted’ and riga- ‘irrigate’; siki ‘be-
hind’ and sapu ‘frog’; and hapi- ‘grab’). In Lincha and Tana – Cacra and Hongos’
immediate neighbors to the north-east and south-west, respectively – speakers
may realize word-initial */r/ and */s/ as [l] and [h], respectively, in a few cases
(*runku- > lunku- ‘bag’, *sapa > hapa ‘alone’). These substitutions are not sys-
tematic, however, and remain exceptions.

Tables 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 give the vowel inventory, consonant inventory, and
morphophonemics of syq. If the orthographic form differs either from the usual
orthographic symbol among Andean linguists or from the IPA symbol, these are
noted in square brackets. Parentheses indicate a non-indigenous phoneme.

2.4 Spanish loan words

As detailed in §1.2, syq is extremely endangered: all but the most elderly speak-
ers are bilingual and, indeed, Spanish-dominant. As a result, individual speakers
are not limited by the constraints of Quechuan phonology and generally pro-
nounce loan words with something very close to their original syllable structure
and phonemes, even where these do not conform to the constraints of Quechuan
phonology. With that said, where restructuring does take place, it does so accord-
ing to the rules detailed in §2.4.1.

2.4.1 Spanish loan word restructuring

Syllable structure violations – vowel sequences. In cases where the loaned word
includes the prohibited sequence *VV, syq, like other Quechuan languages, gen-
erally applies one of three strategies: (a) the elimination of one or the other of the
two vowels (aceite → asiti ‘oil’); (b) the replacement of one of the two vowels by
a semiconsonant (cuerpo → kwirpu ‘body’, sueño → suyñu ‘dream’); or (c) the in-
sertion of a semiconsonant between the two vowels (cualquiera → kuwalkiyera
‘any’).

26

2.4 Spanishloanwords

Syllable structure violations – consonant sequences. In case the loaned word in-
cludes a syllable of the prohibited form *CCV or *VCC, syq, again, like other Qu-
echuan languages, employs one of two strategies: (a) the elimination of one of the
two consonants (gringo → ringu ‘gringo’) or (b) the insertion of an epenthetic
vowel (groche → guruchi ‘hook’, ‘crochet’).

Stress pattern violations. Speakers vary in the extent to which they restructure
borrowed Spanish terms to conform to Quechua stress pattern. Plentiful are ex-
amples of both practices:

Table 2.4: Loan word restructuring

No restructuring

kanásta-wan
fwíra-ta
mútu-qa

Sp canásta ‘basket’
Sp fuéra ‘outside’
Sp móto ‘motorcycle’

tirruristá-wan
Kañití-ta
vaká-qa

Sp terrorísta ‘terrorist’
Sp Cañéte ‘Cañete’
Sp váca ‘cow’

Words of five or more syllables permit the preservation of the original Spanish
stress pattern in the interior of a word that still adheres to the Quechua pattern of
assigning stress to the penultimate syllable (timblúr-wan-ráq-tri ‘with an earth-
quake, still, for sure’ (Sp temblór ‘earthquake’)).

Phonemic inventory – consonants. Spanish loan words often feature consonants
foreign to the syq inventory: voiced plosives /b/, /d/ and /ɡ/; voiceless frica-
It might be expected that [b] and
tive /f/; voiced fricative /v/; and trill /rr/.
[d] would be systematically replaced with their voiceless counterparts, [p] and
[t], and that trill [r] would, similarly, be replaced by tap/flap [ɾ]. Speakers of
syq, even the oldest, do not in fact regularly replace these or other non-native
phonemes (balde → baldi ‘bucket’; doctor → duktur ‘doctor’; carro → karru
‘car’; fiesta → fiysta ‘festival’; velar → vilaku- ‘watch’, ‘hold vigil’).

Phonemic inventory – vowels. The inventory of Spanish vowels includes two for-
eign to syq: /o/ and /e/ (Dios ‘God’; leche ‘milk’). As detailed in §2.3, in words
native to syq, [o] and [e] are allophones of /u/ and /i/, respectively. It is to be
expected, then, that speakers would systematically replace the [o] and [e] of
Spanish loan words with native correlates [u] and [i], respectively (sapo → sapu
‘frog’; cerveza → sirbisa ‘beer’). This does indeed occur. More commonly, how-
ever, [o] and [e] are either replaced by the /u/ and /i/ allophones [υ] and [ɪ]

27

2 Phonologyandmorphophonemics

(cosa → [kυsa] ‘thing’, tele → [tɪlɪ] ‘TV’) or, even, not replaced at all. The real-
ization of non-native vowels varies both among speakers and also among words:
different speakers render the same word differently and individual speakers ren-
der the same phoneme differently in different words.

Special case: ado. Spanish loan words ending in -ado – with the non-native
-ado is generally rendered [aw] in syq
/d/ and /o/ – present a special case.
(apurado → apuraw ‘quick’; lado → law ‘place’). 9

Finally, restructuring to accommodate any of the three – stress pattern, syl-
lable structure or phonemic inventory – does not depend on restructuring to
accommodate any of the others. That is, stress pattern can be restructured to
eliminate violations of syq constraints, while violations of constraints on sylla-
ble structure or phonemic inventory are left unrestructured, and similarly for
any of the six possible permutations of the three.

2.4.2 Loan word orthography

I have chosen an orthography that makes use of all and only the letters appearing
in Tables 2 and 2.1, above. Orthography rather strictly follows pronunciation in
the case of consonants in both indigenous and borrowed words; in the case of
vowels in borrowed words, it is something of an idealization (i.e., it should not
in these cases be mistaken for phonetic transcription).

This alphabet does not include the letters c, j, z, e or o, all of which occur in
the original Spanish spelling of many borrowed words. Spanish c, j and z have
been replaced with their syq phonetic equivalents: “hard” c is replaced with k;
“soft” c with s; j with h; and z with s. Thus, the borrowed Spanish words caja
(‘box’, ‘coffin’) and cerveza (‘beer’) are rendered kaha and sirbisa, with no change
in the pronunciation of the relevant consonants in either case. Spanish e and o,
appearing simply, are replaced with i and u (compadre → kumpadri). Spanish
vowel sequences including e and o are replaced as shown in Table 2.5.

In the special case where the sequence ue or ua is preceded by h – generally
not not necessarily silent in Spanish – h and u together are replaced by the semi-
consonant [w] (huérfano → wirfanu ‘orphan’).

9 An anonymous reviewer has brought it to my attention that “in many qi languages, such as
several varieties in Ancash,-ado → /a:/, e.g, apura:. In fact, -la: has become a case suffix ‘at,
near’ that competes with the semantic territory of the native locative.”

28

2.4 Spanishloanwords

I have deviated from these practices only in the case of proper names, spelling
these as they are standardly spelled in Spanish. Thus, Cañete and San Jerónimo,
for example, are not rendered, as they would be under the above conventions,
Kañiti and San Hirunimu. ‘Dios’ (‘God’) is treated as a proper name.

3 Substantives

This chapter covers the various substantives in Southern Yauyos Quechua. It sur-
veys their different classes and describes the patterns of inflection and derivation
in the various dialects of the language.

3.1 Parts of speech

The parts of speech in Southern Yauyos Quechua, as in other Quechuan lan-
guages, are substantives (warmi ‘woman’), verbs (hamu- ‘come’), ambivalents
(para ‘rain, to rain’), and particles (mana ‘no, not’). Substantives and verbs are
subject to different patterns of inflection; ambivalents may inflect either as sub-
stantives or verbs; particles do not inflect.

The class of substantives in Quechuan languages is usually defined as includ-
ing nouns (wasi ‘house’); pronouns (ñuqanchik ‘we’); interrogative-indefinites
(may ‘where’); adjectives (sumaq ‘pretty’); pre-adjectives (dimas ‘too’); and nu-
merals (kimsa ‘three’). All substantives with the exception of dependent pro-
nouns (Sapa ‘alone’) may occur as free forms.

The class of verbs in Quechuan languages is usually defined to include tran-
sitive (qawa- ‘see’), intransitive (tushu- ‘dance’), and copulative (ka- ‘be’) stems.
A fourth class can be set apart: onomatopoetic verbs (chuqchuqya- ‘nurse, make
the sound of a calf nursing’). All verbs, with the exception of haku! ‘let’s go!’,
occur only as bound forms.

Ambivalents form a single class.
The class of particles is usually defined to include interjections (¡Alaláw! ‘How
cold!’); prepositions (asta ‘until’); coordinators (icha ‘or’); pre-numerals (la, las,
occurring with expressions of time); negators (mana ‘no, not’); assenters and
greetings (aw ‘yes’); adverbs (ayvis ‘sometimes’).

The remainder of this section covers substantives; verbs are covered in Chap-

ter 4 and particles in Chapter 5.

3 Substantives

3.2 Substantive classes

In syq, as in other Quechuan languages, the class of substantives comprises six
subclasses: nouns, pronouns, interrogative-indefinites, adjectives, pre-adjectives,
and numerals. §3.2.1–3.2.5 cover each of these in turn. Multiple-class substan-
tives and the dummy noun na are covered in §3.2.6 and 3.2.7, respectively.

3.2.1 Nouns

The class of nouns may be divided into four sub-classes: regular nouns (wayta
‘flower’), time nouns (kanan ‘now’), gender nouns (tiya ‘aunt’), and locative
nouns (qipa ‘behind’). §3.2.1.1–3.2.1.4 cover each of these in turn.

3.2.1.1 Regular nouns

The class of regular nouns includes all nouns not included in the other three
classes. Although in this sense it is defined negatively, as a kind of default class,
it includes by far more members than any of the others. (1–5) give examples.

they may occur adverbally without inflection, as in (1–5).

3.2.1.3 Gender nouns

Nouns indigenous to syq do not inflect for gender. syq indicates biological gen-
der either with distinct noun roots (maqta ‘young man’, pashña ‘young woman’)
or by modification with qari ‘man’ or warmi ‘woman’ in the case of people
(qari wawa ‘boy child’, warmi wawa ‘girl child’) or urqu ‘male’ or trina ‘female’
in the case of animals. A few nouns, all borrowed from Spanish, are inflected for
gender (masculine /u/ and feminine /a/). (1–4) give examples.

3.2.1.4 Locative nouns

Locative nouns indicate relative position (chimpa ‘front’, hawa ‘top’). They are
inflected with the suffixes of the substantive (possessive) paradigm which indi-
cate the person – and, in the case of the first person, also the number – of the
complement noun. (1–5) give examples.

3.2.2 Pronouns

In syq, as in other Quechuan languages, pronouns may be sorted into four classes:
personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, dependent pronouns and interroga-
tive-indefinite pronouns.

The personal pronouns in syq are ñuqa ‘I’; qam ‘you’; pay ‘she/he’; ñuqa-nchik
‘we’; qam-kuna ‘you.pl’; and pay-kuna ‘they’. syq makes no distinction between
subject, object, and possessive pronouns. With all three, case marking attaches
to the same stem: ñuqa (1) ‘I’; ñuqa-ta (1-acc) ‘me’; ñuqa-pa (1-gen) ‘my’ (nomi-
native being zero-marked). Table 3.1 summarizes this information.

The demonstrative pronouns are kay ‘this’, chay ‘that’, and wak ‘that (other)’.
The dependent pronouns are kiki ‘oneself’, Sapa ‘only, alone’, llapa ‘all’, and
kuska ‘together’. These occur only with substantive person inflection, which indi-
cates the person and, in the case of the first person plural, number of the referent
of the pronoun (kiki-y/-: ‘I myself’; sapa-yki ‘you alone’). One additional pronoun
may appear suffixed with substantive person inflection: wakin ‘some …’, ‘the rest
of …’

§3.2.2.1–3.2.2.3 cover the personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, and de-

pendent pronouns. Interrogative-indefinite pronouns are covered in §3.2.3.

3.2.2.1 Personal pronouns ñuqa, qam, pay

syq has three pronominal stems – ñuqa, qam, and pay, as in (1), (2) and (3). These
correspond to the first, second and third persons. Table 3.1 lists the personal
pronouns.

In the verbal and nominal paradigm tables, for reasons of space, I generally do not
list ñuqa-nchik-kuna and ñuqa-kuna with the other first person pronouns in the
headings; it can be assumed that the first patterns with ñuqa-nchik, the second
with ñuqa. In practice, where context does not adequately specify the referent,
speakers of syq make distinctions between the dual, inclusive and exclusive first-
person plural exactly like speakers of English and Spanish do, indicating the dual,
for example, with ishkay-ni-nchik ‘the two of us’; the inclusive with llapa-nchik
‘all of us’; and the exclusive with modifying phrases, as in ñuqa-nchik Viñac-pa
‘we in Viñac’. syq makes no distinction between subject, object (15) and pos-
sessive (16) pronouns. With all three, case marking attaches to the same stem;
nominative case is zero-marked.

3.2.2.2 Demonstrative pronouns kay, chay, wak

(other)’ (1–3).

chay may have both proximate and distal referents. wak is consistently trans-

The demonstrative pronouns may substitute for any phrase or clause (4). They
can but need not inflect for number (2).

In this case, it is generally suffixed with one of the evidentials -mi or -shi and
indicates that the sentence it heads is closely related to the sentence that pre-
cedes it.1 syq demonstrative pronouns are identical in form to the demonstrative
determiners (8–10).

1 As an anonymous reviewer points out, forms such as chay-mi and chay-shi are lexicalized
discourse markers, and, as such “they do not take productive affixes such as -kuna, -pi, or
-man” among others.

3.2.2.3 Dependent pronouns kiki-, Sapa-, llapa-, kuska-

These pronouns are dependent in the sense that they cannot occur uninflected:
the suffixes of the nominal (possessive) paradigm attach to dependent pronouns
indicating the person and – in the case of the first person – sometimes the num-
ber of the referent of the pronoun (llapa-nchik ‘all of us’). Dependent pronouns
function in the manner as personal pronouns do: they may refer to any of the par-
ticipants in an event, subject (5) or object (6); they inflect obligatorily for case (7)
and optionally for number; and they may be followed by enclitics (8).

3.2.3 Interrogative-indefinites
pi, ima, imay, imayna, mayqin, imapaq, ayka

may ‘where’, imayna ‘how’, mayqin ‘which’, imapaq ‘why’, and ayka ‘how much

3 Substantives

or how many’, as shown in Table 3.2. These form interrogative (1–12), indefi-
nite (13–21), and negative indefinite pronouns (22–29). Interrogative pronouns
are formed by suffixing the stem – generally but not obligatorily – with any of
the enclitics -taq, -raq, -mI , -shI or -trI (pi-taq ‘who’, ima-raq ‘what’); indefi-
nite pronouns are formed by attaching -pis to the stem (pi-pis ‘someone’, ima-pis
‘something’); negative indefinite pronouns, by preceding the indefinite pronoun
with mana ‘no’ (mana pi-pis ‘no one’, mana ima-pis ‘nothing’).

The interrogative enclitic is not employed in the interior of a subordinate clause
but may attach to the final word in the clause (¿Pi mishi-ta saru-ri-sa-n-ta qawa-
rqa-nki? ‘Who did you see trample the cat?’ ¿Pi mishi-ta saru-ri-sa-n-ta-ta qawa-
rqa-nki? ‘Who did you see trample the cat?’).
Interrogative phrases generally raise to sentence-initial position (35); they may,
however, sometimes remain in-situ, even in non-echo questions (36).

3.2.4 Adjectives

I follow the general practice in the treatment of adjectives in Quechuan lan-
guages and sort syq adjectives into two classes: regular adjectives (puka ‘red’)
and adverbial adjectives (sumaq-ta ‘nicely’). An additional class – not native to
syq nor Quechua generally – may be distinguished: gender adjectives (kuntinta
‘happy’). All three classes figure towards the end of the stack of potential noun
modifiers, all of which precede the noun. Nouns may be modified by demonstra-
tives (chay trakra ‘that field’), quantifiers (ashlla trakra ‘few fields’), numerals
(trunka trakra ‘ten fields’), negators (mana trakra-yuq ‘person without fields’),
pre-adjectives (dimas karu trakra ‘field too far away’), adjectives (chaki trakra

55

3 Substantives

‘dry field’) and other nouns (sara trakra ‘corn field’). Where modifiers appear in
series, they appear in the order dem-qant-num-neg-preadj-adj-atr-nucleus
(chay trunka mana dimas chaki sara trakra ‘these ten not-too-dry corn fields’).2.
§§3.2.4.1–3.2.4.4 cover regular adjectives, adverbial adjectives, gender adjectives,
and preadjectives. Numeral adjectives are covered in §3.2.5

3.2.4.1 Regular adjectives

The class of regular adjectives includes all adjectives not included in the other
two classes (trawa ‘raw’, putka ‘turbid’). (1–2) give examples. Adjectives are of-
ten repeated. The effect is augmentative (uchuk ‘small’ → uchuk-uchuk ‘very
small’). When adjectives are repeated, the last consonant or the last syllable of
the first instance is generally elided (alli-allin ‘very good’, hat-hatun ‘very big’).

3.2.4.3 Gender adjectives

A few adjectives, all borrowed from Spanish, may inflect for gender (masculine
/u/ or feminine /a/) (kuntintu ‘happy’, luka ‘crazy’) in case they modify nouns
referring to animate male or female individuals, respectively. Some nouns in-
digenous to syq specify the gender of the referent (masha ‘son-in-law’, llumchuy
‘daughter-in-law’) (1).

Where it is necessary to specify the gender of the referent of a noun that does

trina ‘female’ in the case of animals (5), (6).

3.2.5 Numerals

syq employs two sets of cardinal numerals. The first is native to Quechua; the
second is borrowed from Spanish. The latter is always used for time and almost al-
ways for money. Also borrowed from Spanish are the ordinal numerals, primiru
‘first’, sigundu ‘second’, and so on. There is no set of ordinal numerals native to
syq. §§3.2.5.1–3.2.5.3 cover general numerals, ordinal numerals, and time numer-
als in turn. §3.2.5.4 and 3.2.5.5 cover numerals inflected for possessive and the
special case of huk ‘one’, respectively.

3.2.5.1 General numerals

The set of cardinal numerals native to syq includes twelve members: huk ‘one’;
ishkay ‘two’; kimsa ‘three’; tawa ‘four’; pichqa ‘five’; suqta ‘six’; qanchis ‘seven’;
pusaq ‘eight’; isqun ‘nine’; trunka ‘ten’; patrak ‘hundred’; and waranqa ‘thou-
sand’ (1–3).

3.2.5.3 Time numerals and pre-numerals

syq makes use of the full set of Spanish cardinal numerals: unu ‘one’, dus ‘two’,
tris ‘three’, kwatru ‘four’, sinku ‘five’, sis ‘six’, siyti ‘seven’, uchu ‘eight’, nuybi
‘nine’, dis ‘ten’, and so on. It is this set that is used in telling time. As in Spanish,
time numerals are preceded by the pre-numerals la or las (1).

3 An anonymous reviewer points out that “most Quechuan languages express ordinals by at-
taching the enclitic -kaq to the numeral,” as in ishkay-kaq ‘second’, literally ‘that which is
number two’. “The -kaq enclitic derives historically from the copula *ka- plus agentive *-q.”
This structure is not attested in Yauyos.

3.2.6 Multiple-class substantives

Some substantives are ambivalent. Regular nouns may appear as regular mod-
ifiers (1) and adverbial adjectives (2); interrogative pronouns as indefinite and
relative pronouns (3); dependent pronouns as unit numerals (4); unit numerals
as pronouns (5), (6); and dependent pronouns as adverbs (7) and quantitative (8)
adjectives. Table 3.3 gives some examples.

3.2.7 Dummy na

na is a dummy noun, standing in for any substantive that doesn’t make it off the
tip of the speaker’s tongue (1), (2).

3.3 Substantive inflection

Substantives in syq, as in other Quechuan languages, inflect for person, number
and case. This introduction summarizes the more extended discussion to follow.
The substantive (“possessive”) person suffixes of syq are -y (amv, lt) or -: (ach,
ch, sp) (1p), -Yki (2p), -n (3p), and -nchik (1pl) (mishi-y, mishi-: ‘my cat’; asnu-yki
‘your donkey’). Table 3.4 below displays this paradigm.
The plural suffix of syq is -kuna (urqu-kuna ‘hills’).
syq has ten case suffixes: comparative -hina (María-hina ‘like María’); limi-
tative -kama (marsu-kama ‘until March’); allative, dative -man (Cañete-man ‘to
Cañete’); genitive and locative -pa (María-pa ‘María’s’ Lima-pa ‘in Lima’); ab-
lative, benefactive, and purposive -paq (Viñac-paq ‘from Viñac’, María-paq ‘for
María,’ qawa-na-n-paq ‘in order for her to see’); locative -pi (Lima-pi ‘in Lima’);
exclusive -puRa (amiga-pura ‘among friends’); causative -rayku (María-rayku ‘on
account of María’); accusative -ta (María-ta ‘María’ (direct object)), and comita-
tive and instrumental -wan (María-wan ‘with María’, acha-wan ‘with an axe’).
Table 3.5 below displays this paradigm.

All case marking attaches to the last word in the nominal phrase. When a stem
bears suffixes of two or three classes, these appear in the order person-number-
case (1), (2).

(1)

3.3 Substantiveinflection

Sections §3.3.1–3.3.3 cover inflection for possession, number and case, respec-
tively. Most case suffixes are mutually exclusive; §3.3.3.2 gives some possible
combinations.

3.3.1 Possessive (person)

The possessive suffixes of syq are the same in all dialects for all persons except
the first-person singular. Two of the five dialects – amv and lt – follow the qii
pattern, marking the first-person singular with -y; three dialects – ach, ch, and
sp – follow the qi pattern, marking it with -: (vowel length). The syq nominal
suffixes, then, are: -y or -: (1p), -Yki (2p), -n (3p), -nchik (1pl). Table 3.4 lists the
possessive suffixes.

Stems of the following substantive classes may be suffixed with person suffixes:
nouns (wambra-yki ‘your child’) (1), general numerals (kimsa-nchik ‘the three
of us’) (2), dependent pronouns (kiki-n ‘she herself’) (3), demonstrative pronouns
(chay-ni-y ‘this of mine’) (4) and interrogative-indefinites (5).

Finally, possessive suffixes attach to the subordinating suffix -pti as well as to the

4 An anonymous reviewer writes, “As a loan word, most Central Quechuan languages have
papa: with final vowel length (reinterpretation of final accent in Spanish ‘papá’). As such, -ni
is required before a syllable-closing suffix, such as -y. Though papa does not end in a long
vowel in SYQ, it probably did at one time, and the effect is retained.”

Finally, words borrowed from Spanish already inflected for plural – i.e., with
Spanish plural s – are generally still suffixed with -kuna (cosas → kusas-ni-nchik-
kuna) (8).

5 This example is, in fact, ambiguous between as reading in which -kuna receives a non-plural
interpretation and one in which it simply pluralizes the possessed item. Thus, kwirpu-y-kuna
could also refer to ‘your (plural) bodies’, as an anonymous reviewer points out.

3.3.3 Case

A set of ten suffixes constitutes the case system of syq. Table 3.5 gives glossed
examples. These are: -hina (comparative), -kama (limitative), -man (allative, da-
tive), -pa/-pi (genitive, locative), -paq (ablative, benefactive, purposive), -puRa
(exclusive), -rayku (reason), -ta (accusative), and -wan (comitative, instrumental).
Genitive, instrumental and allative/dative may specify noun-verb in addition to
noun-noun relations. -pa is the default form for the locative, but -pi is often and
-paq is sometimes used. The ch dialect uses a fourth form, -traw, common to
the qi languages. The ch dialect is also unique among the five in its realization
of accusative -ta as -kta after a short vowel. -puRa – attested only in Viñac –
and -rayku are employed only rarely. The genitive and accusative may form ad-
verbs (tuta-pa ‘at night’, allin-ta ‘well’). Instrumental -wan may coordinate nps
(llama-wan alpaka-wan ‘the llama and the alpaca’). All case processes consist
in adding a suffix to the last word in the nominal group. Most case suffixes are
mutually exclusive. §3.3.3.1–3.3.3.12 cover each of the case suffixes in turn.

3.3.3.1 Simulative -hina

The simulative -hina generally indicates resemblance or comparison (yawar-hi-
na ‘like blood’) (1– 7).

It can generally be translated ‘because’, ‘because of’ or ‘on account of’. -rayku is
not frequently employed: ablative -paq is more frequently employed to indicate
motivation or reason (5), although this -paq does not, as an anonymous reviewer
points out, mark the same relation. -kawsu (Sp. causa ‘cause’) may be employed
in place of -rayku (6). Recognized but not attested spontaneously outside amv

3.3.3.9 Accusative -Kta and -ta

In the ch dialect, the accusative is realized -kta after a short vowel and -ta after
a long vowel or consonant (1), (2); in all other dialects it is realized as -ta in all
environments. -ta indicates the object or goal of a transitive verb (3), (4).

3.3.3.11 Possible combinations

Combinations of case suffixes are rare. They do occur, however, notably with -pa,
-wan, and -hina. Where a noun phrase marked with genitive -pa or -paq functions
as an anaphor, the phrase may be case marked as its referent would be (1), (2).
Note that in (2) the accusative has no phonological reflex in the English gloss.

3.3.3.12 More specific noun-noun relations

Noun-noun relations more specific than the ‘in’ and ‘of’, for example, of -pi and
-pa are expressed by noun phrases headed by nouns which name relative posi-
tions (see §3.2.1.4 on locative nouns) (1–4). Such nouns include, for example, qipa
‘rear’; hawa ‘top’; and trawpi ‘center’. The head (relational) noun is inflected for
person, agreeing with the noun to which it is related; this noun may be inflected
with genitive -pa (pantyun-pa qipa-n ‘behind the cemetery’ lit. ‘of the cemetery
its behind’).

3.4 Substantive derivation

In syq, as in other Quechuan languages, suffixes deriving substantives may be
divided into two classes, governing and restrictive. Governing suffixes may be
further divided into two subclasses: those which derive substantives from verbs
(-na, -q, -sHa, -y) and those which derive substantives from other substantives
(-ntin, -sapa, -yuq, -masi). syq has a single restrictive suffix deriving substan-
tives, diminutive -cha. -lla also functions to restrict substantives, but it is treated
here not as a derivational morpheme but as an enclitic. §§3.4.1 and 3.4.2 cover
the the governing suffixes deriving substantives from verbs and those deriving
substantives from other substantives, respectively.

3.4.1 Substantive derived from verbs

Four suffixes derive substantives from verbs in syq: -na, -q, -sHa, and -y. All four
form both relative and complement clauses. -na, -q, -sHa, and -y form subjunc-

98

3.4 Substantivederivation

tive, agentive, indicative, and infinitive clauses, respectively. The nominalizing
suffixes attach directly to the verb stem, with the exception that the first- and
second-person object suffixes, -wa/ma and -sHa, may intervene. §3.4.1.1–3.4.1.4
cover -na, -q, -sHa, and -y in turn.

3.4.1.1 -na

-na derives nouns that refer to (a) the instrument with which the action named
by the base is realized (alla-na ‘harvesting tool’) (1), (2); (b) the place in which
the event referred to occurs (michi-na ‘pasture’) (3); and (c) the object in which
the action named by the base is realized (upya-na ‘drinking water’, milla-na ‘nau-
sea’) (4), (5).

3.4.2 Substantives derived from substantives

Four suffixes derive substantives from substantives in syq: -kuna, -ntin, -sapa,
and -yuq. The first two of these – -kuna and -ntin – indicate accompaniment,
adjacency, or completeness (llama-n-kuna ‘with her llama’, amiga-ntin ‘with her
friends’); -yuq and -sapa indicate possession (llama-yuq ‘person with llamas’,
llama-sapa ‘person with more llamas than usual’). §3.4.2.1–3.4.2.4 cover -kuna,
-ntin, -sapa; and -yuq, in turn.

3.4.2.1 Non-exhaustivity -kuna2

-kuna2 indicates that the referent of its base is accompanied by another entity,
generally of the same class (qusa-yki-kuna ‘your husband and all’) (1–4).

‘memory’ → yuya-y-sapa ‘person with a memory better than usual’. In the liter-
ature on Quechua it is sometimes referred to as “super” possession (posession of
more than usual).

4 Verbs

This chapter covers the verbal system of Southern Yauyos Quechua.
Its four
sections treat verb stems, verb types, verbal inflection and verbal derivation, in
that order.

4.1 Verb stems

In Southern Yauyos Quechua, as in other Quechuan languages, verb stems al-
ways end in a vowel (yanapa- ‘help’). Verb stems are bound forms: with the
single exception of haku ‘let’s go!’ they never appear in isolation. They are sub-
ject to both inflectional and derivational processes, both suffixing (wañu-n, die-3,
‘they die’; wañu-chi-n, die-caus-3, ‘they kill’). The order of inflectional suffixes
is fixed; the order of derivational suffixes is highly regular but admits exception.
Inflection for person is obligatory (*qawa-katra-ya see-freq-prog); derivational
processes are optional (qawa-n see-3). The different person suffixes are mutually
exclusive; different derivational suffixes may attach in series (qipi-ra-chi-ku-sa
carry-urgt-caus-refl-npst ‘she got herself carried’).

4.2 Types of verbs

Quechua verb stems are usually classed as (di-)transitive (qu- ‘give’, riku- ‘see’),
intransitive (puñu- ‘sleep’), or copulative (ka- ‘be’). A fourth class can be set
apart: onomatopoetic verbs (chuqchuqya- ‘nurse, make the sound of a calf nurs-
ing’). Special cases include the deictic verb hina-, the dummy verb na-, and the
combining verbs -naya- ‘give desire’ (§4.4.1.6) and -na- ‘do what, matter, and
happen’ (§4.4.1.5). §4.2.1–4.2.4 cover transitive, intransitive, equational, and ono-
matopoetic verbs, in turn.

4.2.1 Transitive verbs

Transitive verbs are standardly defined for Quechuan languages as those that
can take regular-noun direct objects case-marked accusative (llama-ta maqa-rqa
‘They hit the llama’) (1–4).

‘Toss out the cows, all of them! I’m going to go up hill.’

In addition to regular transitives, verbs of motion (lluqsi- ‘leave’) (5) and imper-
sonal (“weather”) verbs (riti- ‘snow’) (6), (7) may appear in clauses with regular
nouns case-marked -ta. In these instances, however, -ta does not indicate ac-
cusative case.1

1 An anonymous reviewer points out that the verbs in (6) and (7) could be interpreted as tran-
sitive (telic) verbs with accusative arguments. para-, for example, is interpretable as ‘rain on’
and pukuta- as ‘cloud over’, in which case -ta in llaqta-yki-ta and-kta in llaqta-kta would have
to be interpreted as genuine accusatives.

4.2.2 Intransitive verbs

Intransitive verbs are those, like puñu- ‘sleep’ (1) and wiña- ‘grow’ (2), that can-
not occur in clauses including a regular noun case-marked accusative (*puñu-ni
kama-ta target meaning: ‘I sleep the bed’). Also included among the intransitives
are the impersonal weather verbs, like qasa- ‘freeze’, which do not take subjects
(qasa-ya-n ‘it’s freezing’).2

Verbs of motion (hamu- ‘come’, lluqsi- ‘exit’) form a subclass of intransitive verbs.
These often have adverbial complements marked with the directional suffixes -ta
(accusative), -man (allative, dative), -paq (ablative) and -kama (limitative) (3), (4),
and they may occur in clauses that include a nominalization with the agentive
suffix -q indicating the purpose of movement (5), (6).

pretations.

4.2.4 Onomatopoetic verbs

Onomatopoetic verbs can be distinguished from other verbs by the shape of their
stem. The majority involve the repetition – two to four times – of a syllable or
syllable group, most often with the suffixation of -ya. Four patterns dominate:

Pattern 1: ([C1V1(C2)]S1)[C1V1(C2)]S1[C1V1(C2)]S1 (-ya)(-ku)
Pattern 1 involves the repetition of a single syllable twice or three times, gener-
ally with -ya or, more rarely, -ku or -ya-ku, i.e., (S1)S1S1 (-ya)(-ku).
qurqurya- ‘snore’ and luqluqluqya- ‘boil’ are two good examples. Further exam-
ples are given in Table 4.1.

Pattern 2: [C1V1(C2)]S1[C3V1]S2[C3V1]S2[C3V1]S2(-ya)(-ku)
Pattern 2, like Pattern 1, involves the repetition of a single syllable generally with
-ya or, more rarely, -ku or -ya-ku. Pattern 2 differs from Pattern 1, however, in
that the repeated syllable is (1) always repeated three times; (2) never includes a
coda; and (3) is preceded by a non-cognate syllable which generally if not always
includes the same vowel as does the repeated syllable, i.e., S1S2S2S2(-ya)(-ku).
bunrururu- ‘thunder’ is a good example of this pattern. Further examples are
given in Table 4.2.

Pattern 3:
([[C1V1(C2)]S1[C1V1(C2)]S2]U1)[[C1V1(C2)]S1[C1V1(C2)]S2]U1[[C1V1(C2)]S1[C1V1(C2)]S2]U1(-ya)(-ku)

One example is chiplichipli- ‘sparkle’. Further examples are given in Table 4.3.

Pattern 4: Pattern 4, like Patterns 1 and 3, involves the repetition of a single syl-
lable or two-syllable unit two or three times, generally with -ya or -ku. Pattern 4
differs from Patterns 1 and 3, however, in that the final consonant in the final it-
eration is eliminated or changed. Examples of this pattern include waqwaqwaya-
‘guffaw’ and chalaqchalanya- ‘clang’. Table 4.4 supplies more.

There are further, less common variations. For example, kurutukutu- ‘make
the sound of a male guinea pig chasing a female guinea pig’ involves the repe-

4.3 Verb inflection

4.3.1 Summary

Verbs in syq, as in other Quechuan languages, inflect for person, number, tense,
conditionality, imperativity, aspect, and subordination.

In practice, syq counts three persons: first, second, and third (ñuqa, qam, and
pay). syq verbs inflect for plurality in the first person (-nchik); singular and plural
suffixes are identical in the second and third persons (-nki, -n). Although syq
makes available a three-way distinction between dual, inclusive and exclusive
in the first person plural (ñuqanchik, ñuqanchikkuna, nuqakuna), in practice, in
all but the ch dialect, the dual form is employed in all three cases; inclusive
and exclusive interpretations are supplied by context, both linguistic and extra-
linguistic.

Transitive verbs with non-reflexive first or second person objects inflect for
actor-object reference (-wan, -yki, etc.) Verbal inflection in syq marks three
tenses, present, past (-RQa), and future (portmanteau); the perfect (-sHa); the pro-
gressive (-ya); the present and past conditional (-man (karqa)); and the second
person and first person plural imperative (-y, -shun) and third person injunc-
tive (-chun). In practice, syq counts two adverbial subordinating suffixes, one
employed when the subjects of the main and subordinated clauses are different
(-pti); the other when they are the identical (-shpa). A third subordinating suf-
fix (-shtin), also employed when the subjects of the two clauses are identical, is
recognized, if not frequently used. Inflectional suffixes (ia) follow derivational
suffixes (da), if any are present; derivational suffixes attach to the verb stem (vs).
Thus, a syq verb is built: vs – (da) – ia (see §7.1 and 7.12 on constituent order and
sentences).

The dialects of syq differ in the suffixes they employ in the first person. One set
– amv and lt – follow the pattern of the qii languages, employing -ni to mark the
first-person singular nominative and -wa to mark the accusative/dative; another
set – ach, sp, ch – follow the qi pattern, employing -: (vowel length) for the
first-person singular nominative and -ma for the accusative dative. The person-
number suffixes are: -ni or -: (1p), -nki (2p), -n (3p), and -nchik or -ni/ -: (1pl).
syq verbs also inflect for actor-object reference. The subject-object suffixes are:
-yki (1>2), -wanki or -manki (2>1), -wan or -man (3>1, -shunki (3>2), -wanchik or
-manchik (3>1pl), and -sHQayki (1>2.fut). Examples: ni-nki ‘you say’; qawa-yki
‘I see you’ (see §4.3.2).

The simple present tense is unspecified for time. It generally indicates tempo-
rally unrestricted or habitual action. The simple present tense is indicated by the

129

4 Verbs

suffixation of person-number suffixes alone; these are unaccompanied by any
other inflectional markers. Example: yanu-ni (sapa puntraw) ‘I cook (every day)’
(see §4.3.3.1).

Future suffixes simultaneously indicate person, number and tense. The future
suffixes are: -shaq (1p), -nki (2p), -nqa (3p), and -shun (1pl). Note that the second
person future suffix is identical to the second person simple present suffix. Ex-
amples: chawa-shaq ‘I will milk’; pawa-nki ‘you will jump’; picha-nqa ‘they will
sweep’ (see §4.3.3.2).

The simple past tense alone generally does not receive a completive interpreta-
tion; indeed, speakers generally translate it into Spanish with the present perfect.
The simple past tense is indicated by the suffix -RQa, realized as -rqa in amv, -ra
in ach, lt, sp, and -la in ch. These are immediately followed by person-number
suffixes which are identical to the present tense person-number suffixes with
the single exception that the third person is realized not as -n but as -ø. Exam-
ples: qawa-rqa-ni ‘I saw’ or ‘I have seen’; patrya-la-ø ‘it/they exploded or ‘it/they
has/have exploded’; hamu-ra-nki ‘you came’ or ‘you have come’ (see §4.3.3.3.1).
The quotative simple past tense can be used in story-telling. The quotative
simple past is indicated by the suffix -sHQa, realized as -sa in ach, amv and sp
and -sha in ch and lt. It is sometimes realized in all dialects as -shqa in the first
and sometimes last line of a story. Examples: nasi-sa-: ‘I was born’; ri-shqa ‘he
went’; hamu-sa-ø ‘they came’ (see §4.3.3.3.2).

Within the morphological paradigm, -sHa – realized as -sa in ach, amv and
sp and -sha in ch and lt – occupies a slot that seems to be reserved for the
perfect. Its interpretation, however, is more subtle and it is most often employed
as a completive past. -sHa is immediately followed by the same person-number
suffixes as is simple past (i.e., the third person is realized as -ø). Example: ri-sa-nki
‘you have gone’ (see §4.3.3.3.3).

The iterative past is indicated by the combination – as independent words –
of the agentive verb form (V-q) and – in the first and second persons – the corre-
sponding present tense form of the verb -ka ‘to be’. Examples: ri-q ‘she used to
go’; ri-q ka-nchik ‘we used to go’ (see §4.3.3.3.4).

The conditional (also called “potential” or “irrealis”) covers more territory than
does the conditional in English. It corresponds to the existential and universal
ability, circumstantial, deontic, epistemic, and teleological modals of English. The
regular conditional is indicated by the suffix -man. -man is immediately preceded
by person-number suffixes. In the case of the first person singular, the suffixes of
the nominal (possessive) paradigm are employed: -y in the amv and lt dialects
and -: in the ach, ch, and sp dialects. Alternative conditional forms are attested
in the second person both singular and plural in the amv dialect and first person

130

4.3 Verbinflection

plural in all dialects. -waq indicates the second person conditional; -chuwan, the
first person plural conditional. Both these morphemes simultaneously indicate
person and conditionality and are in complementary distribution both with tense
and inflectional morphemes. The past conditional is formed by the addition of
ka-RQa – the third person simple past tense form of ka- ‘be’ to either the regular
or alternative present tense conditional form. Examples: ri-nki-man ‘you can go’;
ri-chuwan ‘we can go’ (see §4.3.4).

Imperative suffixes simultaneously indicate person, number and imperativity.
The imperative suffixes are: -y (2p) and -shun (1pl); the injunctive suffix is -chun
(1pl). Examples: ¡Ri-y! ‘Go!’, ¡Ruwa-shun! ‘Let’s do it!’, and ¡Lluqsi-chun! ‘Let him
leave!’ (see §4.3.5).

Progressive aspect is indicated by the derivational suffix -ya. -ya precedes4
person-number suffixes and time suffixes, if any are present are present. Exam-
ple: ri-ya-n ‘she/he/they is/are going’; ri-ya-ra-ø ‘she/he/they was/were going’
(see §4.3.6).

Subordination is not entirely at home with verbal inflection. Subordinating
suffixes are different from inflectional suffixes in that, first, they cannot com-
bine with tense, imperativity, or conditionality suffixes, and, second, they are in-
flected with the person-number suffixes of the nominal paradigm and not those
of the verbal paradigm. syq makes use of three subordinating suffixes: -pti, -shpa
and -shtin: -pti is used when the subjects of the main and subordinate clauses
are different; -shpa and -shtin, when the subjects are identical. Cacra, following
the pattern of the qi languages, uses -r (realized [l]) in place of -shpa. -pti is
generally translated ‘when’, but also occasionally receives the translations ‘if’,
‘because’, or ‘although’. -shpa may receive any of these translations, but is most
often translated with a gerund. -shtin is translated with a gerund exclusively. All
three inherit tense, conditionality, and aspect specification from the main-clause
verb. -pti always inflects for person-number; -shpa and -shtin never do. Person-
number suffixes are those of the nominal paradigm: -y or -: (1p), -Yki (2p), -n (3p),
and -nchik (1pl). Examples: Hamu-pti-ki lluqsi-rqa-ø ‘when/because you came,
she left’; Kustumbra-ku-shpa hawka-m yatra-ku-nchik ‘When/if we adjust, we
live peacefully’ (see §4.3.7).

Table 4.5 summarizes this information. In this and the tables that follow, for
reasons of space, unless otherwise specified, all dialects employ the same forms.

4 The derivational affixes -mu, -chi, and -ru may intervene between -ya and the inflectional

affixes.

4 Verbs

The following abbreviations and conventions are employed:

→ he/she/it/they

‘you’ → you.s/you.pl
‘he’
‘can …’ → can/could/will/would/shall/should/may/might
‘could …’ → could/would/should/might
‘when …’ → when/if/because/although/not until or V-ing

A verb appearing inside angled brackets <like this> indicates a root without

tense, conditionality or aspect specified.

Dialects differ from each other in four sets of cases. They diverge in terms of
(1) their treatment of the first person singular and the first person plural exclusive;
(2) their realization of the simple past tense morpheme -RQa; (3) their realization
of the perfect morpheme -sHa and (4) their realization of */r/.

Table 4.5 displays the differences among the dialects that are relevant to verbal

inflection.

Tables 4.6 and 4.7 give the verbal inflection paradigm of syq. All processes
are suffixing, i.e., a verb root precedes all inflectional morphemes. Translations
are given as if for the verb ni- ‘say.’ Details of form and use as well as extensive
examples follow in §4.3.2–4.3.7.

4 Verbs

4.3.2 Person and number

syq non-subordinate verbs inflect for actor and object reference; substantives
inflect for allocation.

4.3.2.1 Subject

The first person is indicated in both the verbal and substantive paradigms in ach,
ch, and sp by -:ach,ch,sp; in amv, lt; these are indicated by -niamv,lt, and -yamv,lt,
respectively. -: and -ni attach to verb stems (plus derivational or inflectional suf-
fixes, if any are present, with the single exception that -ni cannot precede the
conditional suffix -man) (puri-ni, puri-: ‘I walk’). -: and -y attach to the subordi-
nating suffix -pti (qawa-pti-y, qawa-pti-: ‘when … I see’) and to the verb stem in
the conditional (lluqsi-y -man, lluqsi-:-man ‘I could leave’).

In all dialects the second person is indicated in the verbal paradigm by -nki and
in the substantive paradigm by -yki. -nki attaches to verb stems (plus derivational
or inflectional suffixes, if any are present, except -man) (puri-nki ‘you walk’); the
-yki allomorph -ki attaches to the subordinator -pti (qawa-pti-ki ‘when … you see’.
In Cacra, -k indicates that the second person is the object of an action by the first
person in the present tense (qu-k ‘I give you’).

-n indicates the third person and -nchik refers to a group that includes the
speaker and the addressee and, potentially, others in both the verbal and sub-
stantive paradigms. -n and -nchik attach to verb roots (plus derivational and
inflectional suffixes, if any are present) (puri-n ‘he/they walk/s’; puri-nchik ‘we
walk’) and the the subordinating suffix -pti as well (qawa-pti-n ‘when … you see’
qawa-pti-nchik ‘when … you see’). This information is summarized in Table 4.8.

4.3.2.2 Actor and object reference

-waamv,lt and -maach,ch,sp indicate a first person object. Followed by the second
person verbal suffix (-nki) -wa and -ma indicate that the speaker is the object of
action by the addressee (qu-wa-nki, qu-ma-nki ‘you give me’) (1), (2); followed
by third person verbal suffix (-n), they indicate that the speaker is the object of
action by a third person (qu-wa-n, qu-ma-n ‘he/she/they give/s me’) (3), (4).

Both object and subject suffixes – -wa/-ma, -shu and -sHQa, as well as -nki, -YkI ,

Exceptions to these rules arise when object is 1pl. First, the first-person object
pluralizer, -nchik, does not precede aspect, tense, subordinating, nominalizing
and conditional suffixes, but, rather, succeeds them (ñiti-ru-wa-n-man-chik ‘it
could crush us’) (33–35).

Finally, third, just as the 1pl conditional may be indicated by either of two forms,
one regular (-nchik-man) one alternative/portmanteau (-chuwan), the 3>1pl con-
ditional, too, may be indicated by both regular (-wa/ma-n-man-chik) and port-
manteau forms (-wa/ma-chuwan) (chuka-ru-wa-chuwan ‘it can make us sick’):

A typological note: number is expressed in spontaneously-occurring examples
only in those cases in which there is a first-person plural object (43). In these
cases all syq dialects follow the Southern qii pattern ordering suffixes: obj-tns-
sbj-num. Note, though, that while in the Southern qii languages -chik pluralizes
the subject, in syq -chik pluralizes the object. There are no spontaneous examples
following the Central qii pattern num-obj-tns-sbj.

There are no special forms for third-person objects. A third-person object is
indicated by the case-marking of the third-person pronoun pay with either ac-
cusative -ta or allative/dative -man (pay-ta qawa-nchik ‘we see him/her,’ pay-
kuna-man qu-nki ‘you give them’) (44).

There are no special forms for actors acting on themselves or any group that
includes them: reflexive action is indicated with the derivational suffix -ku. ‘I see
myself ‘ is ñuqa qawa-ku-ni/-: and ‘I see us’ is ‘ñuqa ñuqanchik-ta qawa-ni/-:.

Actor-object suffixes are employed both with transitive and ditransitive verbs
(Miku-ru-shunki ‘He’s going to eat you’; Kay qullqi-ta qu-sqayki ‘I’m going
to give you this money’). Actor-object suffixes may be reinforced – but not
replaced – by accusative- and dative-marked personal pronouns (Ñuqa--ta-s
harqu-ru-wa-ra-ø ‘He tossed me out, too’).

Except in the two cases 2>1pl and 3>1pl, where -chik indicates a plural object,
when either the actor or the object is plural, the verb optionally takes the joint
action suffix -pakU (3pl>2 Pay-kuna qu-paku-shunki tanta-ta qam-man. ‘They
give you.s bread’; 1>2pl Ñuqa qu-paku-yki tanta-ta qam-kuna-man ‘I give you.pl
bread’). In practice, the plural forms, although recognized, are not spontaneously
invoked.

4.3.3 Tense

syq counts three tenses: present, past, and future (maska-nchik ‘we look for’,
maska-rqa-nchik ‘we looked for’, maska-shun ‘we will look for’). With the excep-
tion of the first person plural, person suffixes in syq are unmarked for number.
-nki corresponds to the second person singular and plural (yanapa-nki ‘you.s/pl
help; maylla-nki ‘you.s/pl wash’). -N corresponds to the third person singu-
lar and plural (taki-n ‘she/he/it/they sing(s)’). §4.3.3.1–4.3.3.3 cover the simple
present, future and past tenses, in turn.

4.3.3.1 Simple present

The present tense subject suffixes in syq are -ni and -: (1P), -nki (2P), -n (3P),
and -nchik (1pl). Examples include: (atrqay-tuku-ni/-: ‘I pretend to be an eagle’,
kundur-tuku-nki ‘you pretend to be a condor’, rutu-tuku-n ‘he pretends to be a
rutu’ (small mountain bird), qari-tuku-nchik ‘we pretend to be men’). Table 4.10
displays the present tense inflectional paradigm; Table 4.11 displays the paradigm
for present tense inflection with actor-object reference (see Subsection 4.3.2.2 for
discussion). 1–8 supply examples.

syq makes available a three-way distinction in the first person plural, between
ñuqanchik (dual), ñuqanchikkuna (inclusive), and ñuqakuna (exclusive). In prac-
tice, ñuqanchik is employed with dual, inclusive and exclusive interpretations
to the virtual complete exclusion of the other two forms, except in the ch di-
alect. Verbs and substantives appearing with the inclusive ñuqanchikkuna in-
flect following the same rules as do verbs and substantives appearing with the
dual/default ñuqanchik (10); verbs and substantives appearing with the exclusive
ñuqakuna inflect following the same rules as do verbs and substantives appearing
with the singular ñuqa (11).

4.3.3.2 Future

4.3.3.3 Past

syq distinguishes between the simple past, the perfect, and the iterative past. The
simple past is indicated by the past tense morpheme -RQa (rima-rqa/ra-nchik
‘we spoke’). In practice -RQa is assigned both simple past and present perfect
(non-completive) interpretations. The quotative simple past (-sHQa) is used in
story-telling (apa-mu-sa-ø ‘she brought it’). The past tense (completive) is indi-
cated by the suffix -sHa (uyari-sa-ni ‘I heard’). The habitual past is indicated by
the agentive noun – formed by the suffixation of -q to the verb stem – in combi-
nation with the relevant present tense form of ka- ‘be’ (taki-q ka-nki ‘you used
to sing’). §4.3.3.3.1–4.3.3.3.4 cover the simple past, the narrative past, the perfect,
and the iterative past, in turn. The past conditional is covered in §4.3.4.3.

153

4 Verbs

4.3.3.3.1 Simple past -RQa -RQa indicates the past tense.5 The morpheme is re-
alized -rqa in amv (1), (2); -ra in ach (3), lt (4), (5), and sp (6); and -la in ch (7), (8).
Table 4.14 displays the simple past tense inflectional paradigm; Table 4.15 dis-
plays the paradigm for simple past tense inflection with actor-object reference
(see Subsection 4.3.2.2 for discussion).

5 -RQa signals the preterite in all Quechuan languages; -RU , according to Cerrón-Palomino
(1987), is a later evolution in some Quechuan languages from the modal suffix -RQu (outward
direction). In Tarma Q and Pacaraos Q -rQu is now a perfective aspect marker Adelaar (1988:
18–29). An anonymous reviewer points out that in Southern Conchucos Quechua, -ru in South-
ern Conchucos Q originally indicated outward direction. It became a derivational perfective
then an inflectional past (see Hintz 2011: 192–197).

4.3.3.3.2 Quotative simple past tense -sHQa In syq, as in other Quechuan
languages, when speakers have only second-hand knowledge of the events they
report, they may recur to a another past tense form, -sHQa, often referred to
as the “narrative past” because it is used systematically in story-telling. In syq,
-sHQa – realized as -sa in ach, amv and sp and as -sha in ch and lt – is used
predominantly in story-telling (1), (2), historical narrative (3–5), and, generally,
in relating information one has received from others (6–10).

4.3.3.3.3 Perfect
-sHa – realized as -sa in ach, amv and sp and as -sha in ch
and lt – may be argued sometimes to admit interpretations cognate with the En-
glish perfect, indicating events beginning in the past and either continuing into
the present or with effects continuing into the present (1–3). Table 4.16 displays
the paradigm for perfect inflection with -sHa; Table 4.17 displays the paradigm
for the inflection of -sHa for actor-object reference (see Subsection 4.3.2.2 for
discussion).

Indeed, speakers offer only simple past translations for verbs suffixed with -sHa;
perfect translations may be offered, rather, for -Rqa, -RU (very rarely), or the

6 The corpus counts 1157 instances of -sHa; a sample of 50 turned up no translation to the Spanish

perfect.

7 In elicitation sessions, speakers of syq do interpret -ri as indicating the present perfect; in a
sample of 50 of the 353 instances of -Ri in the corpus, however, only once did the speakers
assign it a perfect interpretation (Spkr 1: Yapa-mi-k kuti-nqa, ¿aw? Spkr 2: Puchuka-ri -n-chu.
‘She’s going to go back again, no?’ ‘She hasn’t finished yet.’)
8 The the translations in (1–3) were proposed only to suggest possible perfect interpretations of

sentences that, I argued, are better interpreted as narrative pasts.

Speakers do consistently translate the combination of -RU and -sHa with the

not share the semantics of the Standard Spanish.9

Given, however, the restrictions on the distribution of -RU-sHa – it inflects only
for third person10 and it is not contentful either with stative verbs or with the
copulative, ka- – it is improbable that it that would constitute the language’s prin-
cipal strategy for rendering the past perfect. Rather, to indicate the sequence of
two completed events, speakers of syq generally employ ether the subordinator
-pti (11), (12) or a connective like hinashpa or hinaptin (13).11

9 This construction generally can only awkwardly be translated as a past perfect in English,

however.

10 The corpus counts 330 instances of -RU (-ø/-chi/-mu) -sHa; in only two cases is it not inflected

for third person.

11 It has been suggested to me that an additional function of -sHa might be to indicate ‘sudden
discovery’ (Adelaar 1977) or surprise. That is, -sHa might indicate the mirative, as do the perfect
marker -shka in Ecuadorian Q (Muysken 1977) and ‘non-experienced’ past tense marker -sqa
in Cuzco Q (Faller 2003) (as cited in Peterson 2014: 223–33). This is a hypothesis I am currently
investigating.

4.3.4 Conditional

syq verbs inflect for conditionality, present and past. Two different forms in-
dicate the conditional in syq. The first, the regular conditional, is attested in
all persons, singular and plural, in all dialects. Alternative conditional forms are
attested in the first person plural in all dialects and in the second person both sin-
gular and plural in the amv dialect. Both the regular and alternative conditional
may be interpreted as ability, circumstantial, deontological, epistemological, and
teleological modals, both existential and universal, at least. For more extensive
discussion of the interpretation of the conditional under the scope of the various
evidential enclitics and their modifiers, see §6.2.11.

4.3.4.1 Regular conditional (potential) -man

All syq dialects indicate the conditional with the suffix -man. In the first person,
it is the person-number suffixes of the nominal (possessive) paradigm that are
used in combination with -man (i.e., -y and not -ni is used for the first-person sin-
gular in the qii-alligned dialects) (28). -man follows all other inflectional suffixes
(ri-nki-man *ri-man-ni-nki) (34); -man is in complementary distribution with
tense morphemes (*ri-rqa-nki-man) (the examples cited are given in §4.3.4.2).
Table 4.20 displays this paradigm; Table 4.21 displays the paradigm of regular
conditional inflection with actor-object reference (see Subsection 4.3.2.2 for dis-
cussion).

4.3.4.2 Modality

The syq conditional covers far more territory than does the conditional in Span-
ish or English, receiving ability (1–5), circumstantial (6), (7), (8), deontic (9), (10),
(11), (12), teleological (13), (14), and epistemological (15), (16), (17) modal readings,
both existential and universal. Table 4.22 displys the modal system of syq.

As detailed in §6.2.11, syq modals are themselves unspecified for force: modal
force is determined by context and is generally specified by the evidential modi-
fiers. Weak modal readings result when the modal is under the scope either of no
evidential or of an evidential modified by the evidential modifier ø; strong univer-
sal readings result when the evidential is modified by the evidential modifier -iki
(siqa-yku-n-man-tri-ø ‘it might fall’, siqa-yku-n-man-tri-ki ‘it will most likely
fall’; istudya-nki-man-mi-ø ‘you should study’, istudya-nki-man-mi-ki ‘you must
study’); moderately strong modal readings result when the modifier -ik takes

Universal deontic readings additionally follow from the combination of the nom-
inalizer, -na with nominal (possessive) person inflection (25); they are available,
too, with the simple present tense.

vaka
cow

In (26), the adverb hawka ‘tranquil’ modifying a future tense verb receives an
existential deontic modal reading. As detailed in §6.2.11.3, under the scope of
the conjectural evidential, -trI , conditionals are generally restricted to epistemic
interpretations; under the scope of the direct evidential -mI , they receive all but
conjectural interpretations.

The past conditional is indicated by the combination – as distinct words – of
the conditional with ka-RQa, the third person past tense form of ka- ‘be’ (1–

conditional inflection with actor-object reference.

4.3.6 Aspect

In syq, continuous aspect is indicated by -ya. -ya belongs to the set of derivational
affixes. Unlike inflectional morphemes, -ya can appear in subordinate clauses
and nominalizations (puñu-ya-pti-n ‘when he is sleeping’; ruwa-ya-q ‘one who
is making’) and can – and, indeed, sometimes must – precede some derivational
suffixes (miku-ya-chi-n ‘he is making him eat’). Perfective aspect, generally in-
dicated by -Ru, may, in some cases, also be indicated by reflexive -kU . §4.3.6.1–
4.3.6.3 cover -ya and -kU , respectively.

4.3.6.1 Continuous -ya

All dialects of syq indicate continuous aspect with -ya. -ya marks both the pro-
gressive (1–6) and durative components (7), (8) of the continuous, indicating both
actions and states continuing in time.

tive -ya, but it is more semantically restricted than -ya. A -chka action or state is
necessarily simultaneous with some other action or state, either expilicit in the
dialogue (1), (2) or supplied by context (3), (4).

135) writes of Tarma Quechua: “This -ku-, probably the result of a functional
split of the ‘reflexive’ marker -ku-, has acquired a marginal aspectual function
and indicates the completion of a change of position.”

4.3.7 Subordination

syq counts three subordinating suffixes – -pti, -shpa, and -shtin – and one subor-
dinating structure – -na-poss-kama. In addition, the nominalizing suffixes, -na,
-q, -sa, and -y form subordinate relative and complement clauses (see §3.4.1).

-pti is employed when the subjects of the main and su1432bordinate clauses are
different (Huk qawa-pti-n-qa, ñuqa-nchik qawa-nchik-chu ‘Although others see,
we don’t see’); shpa and -shtin are employed when the subjects of the two clauses
are identical (tushu-shpa/-shtin wasi-ta kuti-mu-n ‘Dancing they return home’).
Cacra, but not Hongos, employs -r (realized [l]) in place of -shpa (traqna-l pusha-
la-mu-n ‘binding his hands and feet, they took him along’). -pti generally indi-
cates that the event of the subordinated clause began prior to that of the main
clause but may also be employed in the case the events of the two clauses are si-
multaneous (urkista-qa traya-mu-pti-n tushu-rqa-nchik ‘When the band arrived,
we danced’). -shpa generally indicates that the event of the subordinated clause is
simultaneous with that of the main clause (Sapu-qa kurrkurrya-shpa kurri-ya-n
‘The frog is running going kurr-kurr!’) but may also be employed when event
of the subordinated event precedes that of the main clause. -shtin is employed

191

4 Verbs

only when the main and subordinate clause events are simultaneous (awa-shtin
miku-chi-ni wamra-y-ta ‘(By) weaving, I feed my children’). -pti subordinates
are suffixed with allocation suffixes (tarpu-pti-nchik ‘when we plant’); in con-
trast, -shpa and -shtin subordinates do not inflect for person or number (*tarpu-
shpa-nchik; *tarpu-shtin-yki). -shpa appears 1432 times in the corpus; in three
instances it is inflected for person. In elicitation, speakers adamantly reject the
use of personal suffixes after -shpa. Subordinate verbs are never suffixed with
any other inflectional morphemes, with the exception of -ya (*tarpu-rqa-shpa;
*tarpu-shaq-shpa). The evidentials, -mI , shI , and -trI cannot appear on the in-
terior of subordinate clauses, and the negative particle -chu can neither appear
on the interior nor suffix to subordinate clauses (mana-m rima-pti-ki (*chu) ‘if
you don’t talk’). Subordinate verbs inherit tense, aspect and conditionality speci-
fication from the main clause verb (ri-shpa qawa-y-man karqa ‘If I would have
gone, I would have seen’). Depending on the context, -pti and -shpa can be
translated by ‘when’, ‘if’, ‘because’, ‘although’, or with a gerund; -shtin can be
translated by a gerund only. This information is summarized in Table 4.25.

Identical Subjects

-shpa

-shpa, -shtin

-na-poss-kama is limitative. It forms subordinate clauses indicating that the
event referred to either (1) is simultaneous with or (2) limits the event referred
to in the main clause (puñu-na-y-kama ‘while I was sleeping’; wañu-na-n-kama
‘until she died’).

4.3.7.1 Different subjects -pti

-pti is employed when the subjects in the main and subordinated clauses are dif-
ferent (1), (2) and the event of the subordinated clause begins before (3) or is
simultaneous with (4) the event of the main clause. Table 4.26 displays the pat-
tern of -pti inflection; Table 4.27 gives this pattern with actor-object reference.

4.4 Verb derivation

Five suffixes derive verbs from substantives: factive -cha, reflexive -ku, simulative
-tuku, inchoative -ya. Additionally, two verbs can suffix to nouns to derive verbs:
na- ‘do, act’ and naya- ‘give desire’.

A set of eighteen suffixes derives verbs from verbs. These are: -cha (diminu-
tive); -chi (causative); -ka (passive, accidental); -katra (iterative); -kU (reflexive,
middle, medio-passive, passive, completive); -lla (restrictive, limitative); -mu (cis-
locative, translocative);14 -nakU (reciprocal); -naya (desiderative); -pa (repeti-
tive); -pa(:)kU (joint action); -pU (benefactive); -ra (uninterrupted action); -Ri
(inceptive); -RU (action with urgency or personal interest, completive); -shi (ac-
companiment); -ya (intensifying); and -YkU (exceptional performance). §4.4.1
and 4.4.2 cover suffixes deriving verbs from substantives and from other verbs,
respectively.

4.4.1 Suffixes deriving verbs from substantives

The suffixes deriving verbs from substantives are: factive -cha, reflexive -ku, sim-
ulative -tuku, and inchoative -ya, as displayed in Table 4.28. §4.4.1.1–4.4.1.4 cover
each of these in turn.

‘The eagle disguised himself

‘It dawned.’
‘What am I going to do so that
this earth won’t want me?’
‘You want a girl.’

14 W. Adelaar (p.c.) points out that -mu might also be treated as an inflectional suffix. An anony-
mous reviewer agrees: “the suffixes -ya, -ru and -ri are all more derivational than -mu, [which]
never co-occurs with -ma in QI,” they write. “Rather, -mu and and -ma seem to be in paradig-
matic contrast, where -ma essentially means ‘to ego,’ and -mu means more generally ‘to any
deictic center.”

nouns referring to clothing and other items that can be placed on a person’s body,
-ku derives verbs with the meaning ‘to put on N’ (kata-ku ‘put on a shawl’) (3),
(4); suffixing to adjectives referring to human states – angry, guilty, envious –

4.4.2 Verbs derived from verbs

A set of eighteen suffixes derives verbs from verbs. They are: -cha, -chi, -ka,
-katra, -kU , -lla, -mu, -nakU , -naya, -pa, -pa(:)kU , -pU , -Ra, -Ri, -RU , -shi, -tamu,
and -YkU .

-chi (causative) derives verbs with the meaning ‘cause V’ or ‘permit V’ (wañu-
chi- ‘kill’ (lit. ‘make die’)). Compounded with reflexive -ku, -chi derives verbs
with the meaning ‘cause oneself to V’ or ‘cause oneself to be V-ed’ (yanapa-chi-
ku- ‘get oneself helped’).

-ka (passive/accidental) indicates that the event referred to is not under the
control either of a participant in that event or of the speaker (puñu-ka- ‘fall
asleep’).

-katra (iterative) indicates extended or repetitive action (kurri-katra- ‘to run

around and around’).

-kU (reflexive, middle, medio-passive, passive) derives verbs with the mean-
ings ‘V oneself’ (mancha-ku- ‘scare oneself’, ‘get scared’), ‘V for oneself/one’s
own benefit (suwa-ku ‘steal’) ‘be V-ed’ (pampa-ku- ‘be buried’).

-lla (restrictive, limitative) indicates that the event referred to remains limited

to itself and is not accompanied by other events (lluqsi-lla- ‘just leave’).

-mu (cislocative, translocative) indicates – in the case of verbs involving mo-
tion – motion toward the speaker or toward a place which is indicated by the
speaker (apa-mu- ‘bring here’).

-nakU (reciprocal) derives verbs with the meaning ‘V each other’ (willa-naku-
‘tell each other’); compounded with causative -chi, -nakU derives verbs with the
meaning and ‘cause each other to V’ (willa-chi-naku- ‘cause each other to tell’).
-naya (desiderative) derives a compound verb meaning ‘to give the desire to

V’ (miku-naya- ‘be hungry’ (lit. ‘gives the desire to eat’)).

-pa (repetitive) indicates renewed or repetitive action (tarpu-pa- ‘re-seed’, ‘re-
peatedly seed’); compounded with -ya (intensive) -paya derives verbs meaning
‘continue to V’ (trabaha-paya- ‘continue to work’).

-pa(:)kU (joint action) indicates joint action by a plurality of individuals (traba-

ha-pa:ku- ‘work (together with others)’).

-pU (benefactive) indicates that an action is performed on behalf – or to the
detriment – of someone other than the subject (pripara-pu- ‘prepare (for s.o.
else)’); compounded with -kU , -pU indicates that indicates the action is perfor-
med as a means or preparation for something else more important (including all
remunerated labor) (awa-paku- ‘weave (for others, to make money)’).

-Ra (persistence) derives verbs with the meaning ‘continue to V’ (qawa-ra-
‘look at persistently’); compounded with -ya (intensive) -raya derives passive

209

4 Verbs

from transitive verbs; that is, -raya derives verbs meaning ‘be V-ed’ (wata-raya-
‘be tied’).

-Ri (inceptive) derives verbs meaning ‘begin to V’ (shinka-ri- ‘begin to get

drunk’).

-RU (various) indicates action with urgency or personal interest (chaki-ru- ‘dry
out (dangerously)’); it is very frequently used with a completive interpretation
(kani-ru-n ‘bit’).

-shi (accompaniment) derives verbs meaning ‘accompany in V-ing’ or ‘help V’

(harka-shi- ‘help herd’).

-tamu (irreversible) indicates a change of state that is irreversible (wañu-tamu-

‘die’).

-YkU (exceptional) is perhaps the derivative suffix for which is it hardest to
identify any kind of central interpretation; with regard to cognates in other Que-
chuan languages, it is sometimes said that it indicates action performed in some
way different from usual.
Table 4.29 lists the VV derivational suffixes; associated examples are fully glossed
in the corresponding sections.
Of the eighteen, arguably only four – causative -chi, reflexive -ku, reciprocal
-nakU , and desierative -naya – actually change the root’s theta structure and
derive new lexical items. The rest specify mode and/or aspect and/or otherwise
function adverbally.

The analyses of §4.4.2.1 identify some of the more common possible interpreta-
tions of these suffixes. That said, the interpretations given are hardly exhaustive
or definitive, not least because each generally includes multiple vectors. §4.4.2.3
looks at each of these suffixes in turn. -ya (continuative), also VV derivative
suffix, was treated above in §4.3.6.1.

4.4.2.1 Distribution of VV derivational suffixes

The default order of VV derivational suffixes is given in Table 4.30.
Although this order is generally rigid, some suffixes show optional order when
appearing consecutively. Causative -chi is likely the most mobile; change in its
placement results in a change in verb meaning (wañu-chi-naya-wa-n ‘it makes
me want to kill’ wañu-naya-chi-wa-n ‘it makes me feel like I want to die’ (example
from Albó (1964), as cited in Cerrón-Palomino 1987: 284). -chi and continuative
-ya regularly commute (1), (2), as do exceptional -ykU and reflexive -kU (3), (4).

4.4.2.2 Morphophonemics

In syq, as in other Quechuan languages, the first-person-object suffix -ma (1)
and the cislocative suffix -mu (2) trigger the lowering of a preceding vowel -U-
to -a-; causative suffix -chi does so as well when it precedes -kU , -RU , or -ykU (3).
Table 4.31 displays the pattern of morphophonemic alterations in syq.

Table 4.31: VV derivational suffixes – morphophonemics

U represents an alternation between [u] and [a].

W. Adelaar (p.c.) points out that that “the morphophomemic vowel lowering
presented [here] is not locally restricted.” In miku-yka-ya-chi-n, for example,
he writes, -ykU- is apparently modified to -yka- under the influence of a non-
adjacent suffix -chi-, and in ushtichi-ka-la-mu-y, -kU is apparently modified to
-ka under the influence of the non-adjacent -mu. In these and similar cases, syq
patterns with the Central Peruvian QI, he writes. He suggests that this non-local
vowel lowering may be an archaic feature since Southern Peruvian Quechua does
not have it.

In the case of verbs that do not involve motion, -mu may have various senses.
These may have in common that they all add a vector of movement to the ac-

anonymous reviewer suggests (6), (7).

15 An anonymous reviewer suggests that Yauyos -ru is a “budding completive/perfective aspect
marker, very similar to -rQu in Cuzco and in Huallaga, but less well developed than perfective
-ru in Tarma. And far less developed than past tense/perfective -ru in South Conchucos, where
it has moved to the inflectional tense slot and is in paradigmatic relation with -rQa, -shQa,
futures, conditional, etc.” The reviewer cites Bybee, Perkins & Pagliuca (1994): the inference of
recent past is not uncommon for derivational completive aspect markers.

5 Particles

This chapter covers particles in Southern Yauyos Quechua. In syq, as in most
other Quechuan languages, the class of particles can be sorted into seven sub-
classes: interjections (¡Alaláw! ‘How cold!’); assenters and greetings (aw ‘yes’);
prepositions (asta ‘until’); adverbs (ayvis ‘sometimes’); coordinators (icha ‘or’);
negators (mana ‘no, not’); and prenumerals (la, las, occurring with expressions
of time). Interjections, assenters and greetings, prepositions, and adverbs are cov-
ered in §5.1–5.4, respectively. Coordinators are discussed in §7.3 on coordination;
negators in §7.5 on negation; and prenumerals in Sub §3.2.5.3 on time numerals
and prenumerals.

5.1 Interjections

All spontaneously attested indigenous exclamations share a common pattern:
they begin with a and end in w or, less commonly, in k or y, as in (a-h); with
the exception of the final w, they feature almost exclusively the alveolar and
palatal consonants ch, ll, l, n, ñ, t, and y (which accounts for the entire catalogue
of syq alveolars and palatals with the exception of voiceless fricatives s, sh, and
retroflex tr); they include no vowels except for a; they consist, with few excep-
tions, of three or four syllables; and they bear stress on the final syllable. Syllable
repetition is not uncommon. Non-exclamatory interjections do not follow this
pattern, like in (i) and (j). Curse words are freely borrowed from Spanish (k–m).
Table 5.1 lists some of the more commonly-heard interjections. (1–7) give a few
examples in context.

The Spanish greetings, buynus diyas ‘good day’, buynas tardis ‘good afternoon’
and buynas nuchis ‘good evening’, ‘good night’ (6) have been borrowed into syq
and are employed with greater frequency than are greeting indigenous to the
language. ¡Rimallasayki! ‘I greet you!’ is the most common of the greetings in-
digenous to syq. ¡Saludallasayki! is also used.

5.3 Prepositions

syq makes use of some prepositions borrowed from Spanish. The preposition
most frequently employed is asta (‘up to’, ‘until’, ‘even’, Sp. ‘hasta’ ‘up to’, ‘un-
til’) (1). asta is usually employed redundantly, in combination with the indige-
nous case suffix -kama, apparently with the same semantics (asta aka-kama ‘un-
til here’).

6 Enclitics

This chapter covers the enclitic suffixes of Southern Yauyos Quechua. In syq, as
in other Quechuan languages, enclitics attach to both nouns and verbs as well as
to adverbs and negators. Enclitics always follow all inflectional suffixes, verbal
and nominal; and, with the exception of restrictive -lla, all follow all case suffixes,
as well. syq counts sixteen enclitics. -Yá (emphatic) indicates emphasis. Consis-
tently translated in Spanish by pues.1 -chu (interrogation, negation, disjunction)
indicates absolute and disjunctive questions, negation, and disjunction. -lla (re-
strictive) generally indicates exclusivity or limitation in number; it is generally
translated as ‘just’ or ‘only’. -lla may express an affective or familiar attitude.
-ña (discontinuitive) indicates transition, change of state or quality. In affirma-
tive statements, it is generally translated as ‘already’; in negative statements, as
‘no more’ or ‘no longer’; in questions, as ‘yet’. -pis (inclusion) indicates the in-
clusion of an item or event into a series of similar items or events; it is generally
translated as ‘too’ or ‘also’ or, when negated, ‘neither’. -puni (certainty, preci-
sion); it is generally translated ‘necessarily’, ‘definitely’, ‘precisely’. This last is
attested only in the qii dialects, where it is infrequently employed. -qa (topic
marker) indicates the topic of the clause; it is generally left untranslated.2
-raq (continuative) indicates continuity of action, state or quality. Translated
‘still’ or, negated, ‘yet’. -taq (sequential) indicates the sequence of events. In this
capacity, translated ‘then’ or ‘so’. -taq also marks content questions. -mI (evi-
dential – direct experience) indicates that the speaker has personal-experience
evidence for the proposition under the scope of the evidential. Usually left un-
translated.
-shI (evidential – reportative/quotative) indicates that the speaker has non-perso-
nal-experience evidence for the proposition under the scope of the evidential.
-shI appears systematically in stories. Often translated as ‘they say.’ -trI (ev-

1 An anonymous reviewer points out that pues is used in Andean Spanish “to negotiate common
ground, shared knowledge. As such, it is possible that -ya is also an interactional or stance
marker,” a way a participant in a conversation may negotiate what other participants know or
should know.

2 -qa may nevertheless be indicated in Spanish translations by intonation, gesture, and various

circumlocutions of speech, as an anonymous reviewer points out.

6 Enclitics

idential – conjectural) indicates that the speaker is making a conjecture to the
proposition under the scope of the evidential from a set of propositions for which
she has either direct or not-direct evidence. Generally translated in Spanish as
seguro ‘for sure’, indicating possibility or probability. -ari (assertive force) in-
dicates conviction on the part of the speaker. Translated as ‘certainly’ or ‘of
course’.3 -ik and -iki (evidential modifiers) indicate increasing evidence strength
(and increased assertive force or conjectural certainty, in the case of the direct
and conjectural modifiers, -mI and -trI , respectively). Generally translated in
Spanish as pues and seguro, respectively. Examples in Table 6.1 are fully glossed
in the corresponding sections.

6.1 Sequence

Combinations of individual enclitics generally occur in the following order.

-lla

-puni

-pis

-Raq
-ña

-taq

-chu

-qa
-mI
-shI
-trI

-ikI
-aRi

-Yá

In complementary distribution are: -raq with -ña; the evidentials with each other
as well as with -qa; -ari with -ikI; and -Yá with -ikI .

6.2 Individual enclitics

In syq, as in other Quechuan languages, the enclitics can be divided into two
classes: (a) those which position the utterance with regard to others salient in
the discourse (restrictive/limitative -lla, discontinuative -ña, additive -pis, topic
marking -qa, continuative -Raq, sequential -taq, and interrogative/negative/dis-
junctive -chu); and (b) those that position the speaker with regard to the utter-
ance (emphatic -YÁ, certainty marker -puni, and the evidentials -mi, -shi, and
-tri along with their modifiers -ik, -iki, and -aRi.). §6.2.1–6.2.10 cover all enclitics
except the evidentials and their modifiers, in alphabetical order. The evidentials
and their modifiers are the subject of §6.2.11.

3 An anonymous reviewer writes that in other varieties of Quechuan, “-ari is interpersonal. It

expresses solidarity, affirming what someone else says, thinks or believes to be true.”

6.2.11 Evidence

Evidentials indicate the type of the speaker’s source of information. syq, like
most7 other Quechuan languages, counts three evidential suffixes: direct -mi (1–
3), reportative -shi (4–6), and conjectural -tri (7–9) (i.e. the speaker has her own
evidence for P (generally visual); the speaker learned P from someone else; or the
speaker infers P based on some other evidence). Following a short vowel, these
are realized as -m, sh, and -tr, respectively (3), (6), (9).

The evidential system of syq is unusual among Quechuan languages, however,
in that it overlays the three-way distinction standard to Quechua with a second
three-way distinction. The set of evidentials in syq thus counts nine members:
-mI , -m-ik, and -m-iki; -shI , -sh-ik, and -sh-iki; and -trI , -tr-ik, and -tr-iki. The
-I , -ik, and -iki forms are not allomorphs: they receive different interpretations,
generally indicating increasing degrees of evidence strength or, in the case of
modalized verbs, increasing modal force. §6.2.11 describes this system in some
detail. For further formal analysis, see Shimelman (2012).

In addition to indicating the speaker’s information type, evidentials also func-
tion to indicate focus or comment and to complete copular predicates (for further
discussion and examples, see §7.11 and 7.8 on emphasis and equatives).

Evidentials are subject to the following distributional restrictions. They never
attach to the topic or subject; these are, rather, marked with -qa.
In content
questions, the evidential attaches to the question word or to the last word of the
questioned phrase (10) (see §7.6 on interrogation).

6.2 Individualenclitics

All three evidentials are interpreted as assertions. The first, -mI , is generally
left untranslated in Spanish; the second, -shI , is often rendered dice ‘they say’; the
third is reflected in a change in verb tense or mode (see §6.2.11.3). The difference
between the three is a matter, first, of whether or not evidence is from personal
experience, and, second, whether that evidence supports the proposition, p, im-
mediately under the scope of the evidential or another set of propositions, P’,
that are evidence for p, as represented in Table 6.2.

So, employing -mI (p), the speaker asserts predicate p and represents that she
has personal-experience evidence for p; employing -shI (p), the speaker asserts p
and refers the hearer to another source for evidence for p; and employing -trI (p),
the speaker asserts p and represents that p is a conjecture from P’, propositions
for which she has either -mI -type or -shI -type evidence or both. That is, although
syq counts three evidential suffixes, it counts only two evidence types, direct and
reportative; these two are jointly exhaustive. §6.2.11.1–6.2.11.3 cover -mI , -shI ,
and trI , in turn. §6.2.11.4 covers the evidential modifiers, -ari and -ik/iki.

6.2.11.1 Direct -mI

-mI indicates that the speaker speaks from direct experience. Unlike -shI and
-trI , it is generally left untranslated. Note that in the examples below, with the
exception of (1), the speaker’s knowledge is not the product of visual experience.

from others for which she does have evidence (1–8).

6.2.11.4 Evidential modification

syq counts four evidential modifiers, -ari and the set ø, -ik and -iki. §6.2.11.4.1

melman (2012).

8 The Quechuas of (at least) Ancash-Huailas Parker (1976: 151), Cajamarca-Canaris Quesada
Castillo (1976: 158) and Junin-Huanca Cerrón-Palomino (1976a: 238–9) have suffixes -rI , -rI
and -ari, respectively, which, like the syq -k succeed evidentials and are most often translated
pues ‘then’. It seems unlikely that the ahq, ccq and jhq forms correspond to the -k or -ki of
syq. First, unlike -ik or -iki, -rI and -ari may appear independent of any evidential and they
may function as general emphatics. Second, syq, too, has a suffix -ari which, like -rI and -ari,
functions as a general emphatic, also translating as pues. Third, the syq -ari is in complemen-
tary distribution with -k and -ki. Finally, unlike the ahq, ccq and jhq forms, the syq -ari
cannot appear independently of the evidentials -mI or -shI or else of -y, and, further, always
forms an independent word with these.

Evidentials obligatorily take evidential modifier (hereafter “em”) arguments;
ems are enclitics and attach exclusively to evidentials. So, for example, *mishi-m
[cat-evd] and *mishi-ki (cat-iki) are both ungrammatical. The corresponding
grammatical forms would be mishi-m-ø [cat-evd-ø] and *mishi-mi-ki (cat-evd-
iki), respectively. With all three sets of evidentials, the -ik form is associated with
some variety of increase over the -ø form; the -iki form, with greater increase
still. With all three evidentials, -ik and -iki – except in those cases in which
they take scope over universal-deontic-modal or future-tense verbs – indicate an
increase in strength of evidence. With the direct -mI , -ik and -iki generally also
affect the interpretation of strength of assertion; with the conjectural -trI , the
interpretation of certainty of conjecture. In the case of universal-deontic modal
and future-tense verbs, with both -mI and trI , -ik and -iki indicate increasingly
strong obligation and increasingly imminent/certain futures, respectively.

6.2.11.5 Evidentials in questions

In questions, the evidentials generally indicate that the speaker expects a re-
sponse with the same evidential (i.e., an answer based on direct evidence, reporta-
tive evidence or conjecture, in the cases of -mI , -shI , and -trI , respectively) (1–3).

The use of -trI in a question may, additionally, indicate that the speaker doesn’t
actually expect any response at all (4), while the use of -shI may indicate not
that the speaker is expecting an answer based on reported evidence, but that the
speaker is reporting the question.

7 Syntax

This chapter covers the syntax of Southern Yauyos Quechua. The chapter counts
fourteen sections covering constituent order, sentences, coordination, compar-
ison, negation, interrogation, reflexives and reciprocals, equatives, possession,
topic, emphasis, complementation, relativization and subordination.

7.1 Constituent order

The unmarked constituent order in syq, as in other Quechuan languages, is SOV
(Mila-qa vikuña-n-kuna-ta riku-ra ‘Melanie saw her vicuñas’). That said, be-
cause constituents are obligatorily marked for case, a change in the order of
constituents in an utterance will not necessarily change the sense of that utter-
ance (Mila-qa riku-ra vikuña-n-kuna-ta ‘Melanie saw her vicuñas’). Change in
constituent order does not necessarily change the interpretation of topic or fo-
cus. Topic is generally signaled by -qa, while the evidentials -mI , -shI , and -trI
signal focus (Carmen-qa llama-n-kuna-ta-sh wañu-chi-nqa ‘Carmen will butcher
her llamas, they say’ Carmen-qa llama-n-kuna-ta wañu-chi-nqa-sh ‘Carmen will
butcher her llamas, they say’). In the first case, the focus is on the direct ob-
ject: she will butcher her llamas and not, say, her goats; in the second case, it
is the verb that is marked as the focus: she will butcher her llamas and not, say,
pet them. Nevertheless, the verb and the object cannot commute in subordinate
clauses, where only the order OV is grammatical (fruta-cha-y-kuna apa-sa-y-ta
‘the fruit I bring’ *apa-sa-y-ta fruta-cha-y-kuna-ta).

Modifiers generally precede the elements they modify: adjectives precede the
nouns they modify (yuraq wayta ‘white flower’), possessors precede the thing
possessed (pay-pa pupu-n ‘her navel’), and relative clauses precede their heads
(trabaha-sa-yki wasi-pa ‘in the house where you worked’). In case an NP includes
multiple modifiers, these appear in the order:

(1) dem-qant-num-neg-preadj-adj-atr-nucleus

7 Syntax

7.2 Sentences

With the exceptions of (a) abbreviated questions and responses to questions
(¿May-pi? ‘Where?’ Chay-pi-(m) ‘There’), and (b) exclamations (¡Atatayáw! ‘How
disgusting!’) no syq sentence is grammatical without a verb (*Sasa.
‘Hard’).
As it is unnecessary in syq to specify either the subject or the object, a verb
alone inflected for person is sufficient for grammaticality (Apa-n ‘[She] brings
[it]’). First- and second-person objects are indicated in verbal inflection: -wa/-ma
indicates a first-person object, and -yki, -sHQayki and -shunki indicate second-
person objects (suya-wa-nki ‘you wait for me’ suya-shunki ‘She’ll wait for you’)
(see §4.3.2.2 on actor-object reference).

7.3 Coordination

The enclitics -pis, -taq, and -raq can all be used to coordinate NPs (1–2), AdvPs
and VPs (3); the case suffix -wan can be used with the first two of these three (4).
-pis, -taq, and -raq generally imply relations of inclusion, contrast, or contradic-
tion, respectively. Thus, -pis (inclusion) can generally be translated as ‘and’ or
‘also’ (1), (2).

1 An anonymous reviewer suggests that a better gloss here would be ‘not only women, but men,
too.’ This gloss would be consistent with an analysis of -pis as generally indicating contrast. In
this case, I am directly translating the Spanish gloss suggested to me by my consultant.

7.5 Negation

This section partially repeats §6.2.2 on -chu. Please consult that section for fur-
ther discussion and glossed examples. In syq, negation is indicated by the enclitic
-chu in combination with any of the particles mana, ama, or ni or with the enclitic
suffix -pis. -chu attaches to the sentence fragment that is the focus of negation.
In negative sentences, -chu generally co-occurs with mana ‘not’ (1), (2). -chu is
also licensed by additive -pis (3), (4) as well as by ni ‘nor’ (5), (6).

The enclitic generally attaches to the final word in the interrogative phrase: when
the interrogative pronoun completes the phrase, it attaches directly to the inter-
rogative; in contrast, when the phrase includes an NP, the enclitic attaches to the
NP (pi-paq-taq ‘for whom’ ima qullqi-tr ‘what money’) (16).

7.7 Reflexives and reciprocals

This section partially repeats §4.4.2.3.5 and §4.4.2.3.8 on -ku, and -na Please con-
sult those sections for further discussion and examples. syq employs the verb-
verb derivational suffixes -kU and -nakU to indicate reflexive and reciprocal ac-
tion, respectively.
-kU may indicate that the subject acts on himself/herself or that the subject of
the verb is the object of the event referred to, i.e., -kU derives verbs with the
meanings ‘V one’s self’ (1), (2), and ‘be Ved’ (3), (4). Note that -kU is not restricted
to forming reflexives and may also indicate pseudo-reflexives, middles, medio-
passives and passives.

interpretations. ka- is irregular: its third person singular present tense form, ka-n,
never appears in equational statements, but only in existential statements. ‘This
is a llama’ would be translated Kay-qa llama-m, while ‘There are llamas’ would
be translated Llama-qa ka-n-mi.

7.9 Possession

This section partially repeats §3.3.1 on possession. Please consult that section for
further discussion and glossed examples. syq employs the suffixes of the nominal
paradigm to indicate possession. These are the same in all dialects for all persons
except the first person singular. Two of the five dialects – amv and lt – follow the
qii pattern, marking the first person singular with -y; three dialects – ach, ch,
and sp – follow the qi pattern marking it with -: (vowel length). The syq nominal
suffixes, then, are: -y or -: (1p), -Yki (2p), -n (3p), -nchik (1pl) (1–5). Table 3.4
displays this paradigm.

1 An anonymous reviewer points out that possessive constructions are formed differently in qi:
“The possessed item takes a possessive suffix and the copula takes -pU followed by an object
suffix that agrees with the person of the possessor. In other words, the verbal object suffix and
the possessive suffix refer to the same person.” The reviewer offers the following examples:

Ishkay wa:ka-: ka-pa-ma-n. ‘I have two cows.’
Ishkay wa:ka-yki ka-pu-shu-nki. ‘You have two cows.’
Ishkay wa:ka-n ka-pu-n (or ka-n). ‘She has two cows.’

7.11 Focus

In syq, it is the evidentials, -mI , -shI , and -trI , that, by virtue of their placement,
indicate focus or comment. For example, in (1), the evidential attaches to the
direct object, shakash ‘guinea pig’, and it is that element that is stressed: it is a
guinea pig that you are going to butcher tomorrow. In (2) the evidential attaches
to the temporal noun paqarin ‘tomorrow’, with the resulting interpretation: it is
tomorrow that you are going to butcher a guinea pig. Evidentials never attach
to the topic or subject. Topic and subject are, rather, marked with -qa, as is qam
in (1) and (2).

tive complements with -y (1–3), purposive complements with -q (4), (5), indica-
tive complements with -sHa (6–9), and subjunctive complements with -na (10).
Infinitive complements often figure as the object of the verbs muna- ‘want’ (1),
atipa- ‘be able’ (2), and gusta- ‘like’ (3). Indicative complements are common with
the verbs yatra- ‘know’ (7), (8), qunqa- ‘forget’, qawa ‘see’ (9), and uyari- ‘hear’.
Note that infinitive complements are case-marked with accusative -ta and that
-q purposive complements only occur with verbs of movement (-na-(poss)-paq,
being used for other verb types (11) (see §3.4.1.1)).

The inflected forms may be reinforced with possessive pronouns (6). -sHa may
additionally form nouns referring to the location where (7 or time at which (8)
an event E occurred. -sHa is realized as -sa in ach (5), amv (9) and sp (11) and
as -sha in lt (10) and ch. Any substantive constituent – subject (2), object (9),
or complement (1) – can be relativized. Nominalizing suffixes attach directly to
the verb stem, with the exception that the person suffixes -wa/-ma (first person
object) and -sHu (second person object) may intercede (12), (13).

7.14 Subordination

This section partially repeats §4.3.7 on subordination. Please consult that section
for further discussion and glossed examples. syq counts three subordinating suf-
fixes – -pti, -shpa, and -shtin – and one subordinating structure – -na-poss-kama.
Additionally, in combination with the purposive case suffix, -paq, -na forms sub-
ordinate clauses that indicate the purpose of the action expressed in the main
clause (qawa-na-y-paq ‘so I can see’) (see §3.4.1.1).2

-pti is employed when the subjects of the main and subordinate clauses are
different (huk qawa-pti-n-qa, ñuqa-nchik qawa-nchik-chu ‘Although others see,
we don’t see’) (1); shpa and -shtin are employed when the subjects of the two
clauses are identical (tushu-shpa wasi-ta kuti-mu-n ‘Dancing they return home’)
(2), (3). -pti generally indicates that the event of the subordinated clause began
prior to that of the main clause but may also be employed in the case those
events are simultaneous (urkista-qa traya-mu-pti-n tushu-rqa-nchik ‘When the
band arrived, we dansed’).

ous with that of the main clause (sapu-qa kurrkurrya-shpa kurri-ya-n ‘The frog is

event precedes the main-clause event (5).

-pti subordinates are suffixed with allocation suffixes (tarpu-pti-nchik ‘when we
plant’) (7); -shpa and -shtin subordinates do not inflect for person or number
(*tarpu-shpa-nchik; *tarpu-shtin-yki). Subordinate verbs inherit tense, aspect
and conditionality specification from the main clause verb (Ri-shpa qawa-y-man

Appendix A: Analysis of the Southern
Yauyos Quechua lexicon

What follows is an analysis of lexical differences among the five dialects. This
analysis is excerpted from the introduction to the lexicon that accompanies this
volume.

The lexicon counts 2537 Quechua words. Most were gleaned from glossed
recordings collected in the eleven districts over the course of four years, 2010–
2014; additional terms were identified by eliciting cognate or correlate terms
for various items in Cerrón-Palomino (1994)’s unified dictionary of Southern
Quechua as well as his dictionary of Junín-Huanca Quechua (Cerrón-Palomino
(1976b)). The recordings and annotated transcriptions have been archived by
The Language Archive of the Dokumentation Bedrohter Sprachen/Documenta-
tion of Endangered Languages (DoBeS) archive at the Max Planck Institute (http:
//corpus1.mpi.nl/ds/imdi_browser/?openpath=MPI1052935%23) and the Archive
of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America (AILLA) at the University of Texas
at Austin (http://www.ailla.utexas.org/site/welcome.html). All documents – in-
cluding the unformatted .xml lexical database – can be consulted via those insti-
tutions’ web sites. All terms were reviewed with at least two speakers of each
dialect: Benedicta Lázaro and Martina Reynoso (ah); Mila Chávez, Delfina Chul-
lunkuy, Esther Madueño, Hilda Quispe, and Celia Rojas (mv); Iris Barrosa, Gloria
Cuevas, Senaida Oré, Hipólita Santos, and Erlinda Vicente, (ch); Ninfa Flores and
Sofía Vicente (lt); and Santa Ayllu, Elvira Huamán, Sofía Huamán, and Maxim-
ina P.

As stated in the Introduction, Yauyos is located on the border between the two
large, contiguous zones where languages belonging to the two great branches of
the Quechua language family are spoken: the “Quechua I” (Torero) or “Quechua
B” (Parker) languages are spoken in the regions immediately to the north; the
“Quechua II” or “Quechua A” languages, in the regions immediately to the south.
Both grammatically and lexically, the dialects of southern Yauyos share traits
with both the qi and qii languages. Critically, however, the dialects which sort
with the the qi languages grammatically do not necessarily also sort with them
lexically; nor do the dialects which sort with the qii languages grammatically

A AnalysisoftheSouthernYauyosQuechualexicon

necessarily sort with them lexically. That is, grammatically and lexically, the
dialects cleave along distinct lines.

Grammatically, two of the five dialects – those of Madeán-Viñac and Lincha-
Tana – sort together, as these, like the qii languages, indicate the first-person sub-
ject with -ni, the first-person possessor with -y, and first-person object with -wa.
The remaining three – Azángaro-Huangáscar, Cacra-Hongos, and San Pedro –
sort together, as these, like the qi languages, indicate the first person subject and
possessor with vowel length and the first-person object with -ma.1

Lexically, however, the dialects cleave along different lines, lines defined not
by morphology but by geography. Lexically, the two more northern dialects – the
“qi” ch and the “qii” lt – sort together while the three more southern dialects
– the “qi” ah and sp together with the “qii” mv – sort together. Below, I detail
an analysis of the lexicon that I performed using a subset of 2551 terms. The
dialects generally agree in the terms they use to name the same referent: I could
identify only 37 instances in which the dialects employed words of different roots.
In 32 of these instances the dialects cleaved along north-south lines and in 22 of
the relevant 28 cases for which correlate terms could be identified from Junín-
Huanca Quechua and Ayacucho Quechua (the former a “qi” language spoken
immediately to the north of Yauyos, the second, a “qii” language spoken very
nearby, to the south), the northern dialects employed the term used in Junín-
Huanca, while the southern dialects employed the term used in Ayacucho.2

This does not mean that the dialects employed identical terms in all the re-
maining 2387 cases (subtracting 75 for 36 pairs and one triplet). Far from it. All
dialects employed identical terms in only 1603 instances. Included among these
are all but 20 of the 522 words in the corpus borrowed from Spanish (examples

1 Yauyos counts three additional dialects, spoken in the districts of Alis and Tomas; Huancaya
and Vitis; and Laraos, all located in the north of the province. The lexicon, like the grammar,
makes abstraction of these dialects.

2 No pair was counted more than once. The lexicon includes both roots and derived terms. Thus
both the pairs sumaq (mv, ah, sp) and tuki (ch, lt) ‘pretty’ and sumaq-lla (mv, ah, sp) and
tuki-lla (ch, lt) ‘nicely’ appear in the corpus. Only the root pair, sumaq ~ tuki, was entered
in the catalogue of those cases where dialects differed in root terms employed. There were 116
cases of this type. These were excluded from the count and account given here. Examples are
given immediately below.

qawa- (mv, ah, sp) ~ rika- (ch, lt) ‘see’

→ qawa-chi- ~ rika-chi- ‘show’,’make and offering’

chakwash (mv, ah, sp) ~ paya (ch, lt) ‘old woman’

→ chakwash-ya- ~ paya-ya- ‘become an old woman’

qishta (mv, ah, sp, lt) ~ tunta (ch, lt) ‘nest’

→ qishta-cha- ~ tunta-cha- ‘build a nest’

310

in 1.3 Once terms of Spanish origin are eliminated, we are left with a corpus of
1940 items. All dialects agreed perfectly in their realizations of these items in
1081 cases (56%) (examples in 2). The remaining 755 items are accounted for as
follows. In 154 cases a Quechua-origin term was realized identically in all dialects
in which it was attested but remained unattested in one or more dialects, as in 3.
Given the current state of the language – classified as “moribund” in the 2013 edi-
tion of Ethnologue Lewis, Simons & Fennig (2015)() – nothing can be concluded
from these gaps, neither that the dialects originally employed the same term, nor
that it was necessarily different. In 630 cases, the dialects employed terms of the
same root but with different realizations, as in 4. Included among these are 236
cases where these differences can be attributed to differences in the phonology
between Cacra-Hongos and the other four dialects: the realization of *[r] as [l],
for example (151 cases, examples in 5) or */s/ as [h] (45 cases, examples in 6). Also
counted among these 745 cases are terms affected by metathesis and other phono-
logical processes (vowel lowering (/i/), velarization (/q/), depalatization (/sh/),
and gliding (/y/), among others) (207 cases, examples in 7 and 8). Finally, the
sample counts terms affected by variation in verbal or nominal morphology (62
cases, examples in 9). Principal among these are instances of words derived with
past participles – formed with -sha in the north and -sa in the south – and others
that also differ by virtue of the fronting of /sh/ (40 cases, examples in 10 and 11).

A clear pattern emerges both with regard to the cases where the dialects em-

the dialects cleaved along north-south lines, with the northern dialects – ch and
lt4 – sorting together and the southern dialects – mv, ah, and sp – sorting to-
gether, as in 1.

4 With the exception of two and a half cases: one where lt sorts with the southern di-
alects (‘make an offering’), one where lt recorded no Quechua-origin term (‘bitter’), and one
where Cacra and Hongos split, Cacra alone recording a second term (‘rain’).

23 of the relevant 28 of these 32 cases, the northern dialects – “qi” ch and “qii”

Appendix B: Further analysis of
evidential modifiers

This appendix presents a further analysis of the interpretation of propositions
under the scope of the various permutations of the direct and the conjectural
evidentials – -mI and -trI – in combination with the three evidential modifiers
– -ø, -ik, and -iki.

B.1 The EM’s and the interpretation of propositions under

direct -mI

In the case of the direct -mI , all three forms, -mI-ø, -m-ik, and m-iki, indicate
that the speaker has evidence from personal experience for the proposition im-
mediately under the scope of the evidential. The -ik and -iki forms then indicate
increases in the strength of that evidence, generally that it is increasingly imme-
diate or definitive. For example, consultants explain, with wañu-rqa-ø [die-pst-3]
‘died’, a speaker might use -mI-ø if she had seen the corpse, while she would use
-m-iki if she had actually been present when the person died. Or with para-ya-n
[rain-prog-3] ‘it’s raining’, a speaker might use -mI-ø if she were observing the
rain from inside through a window, while she would use -m-iki if she were actu-
ally standing under the rain. (1) and (2) give naturally-occurring -m-iki examples.
In (1) the speaker reports her girlhood experience working as a shepherdess in
the puna (high, cold, wet pasture grounds). What would run out on her was her
matches. In (2) the speaker reports her experience with the Shining Path, an
armed Maoist group that terrorized the region in the 1980’s with its robberies,
kidnappings and public executions. The fight she refers to is the battle between
the Shining Path and the government Sinchis (commandos). In both examples,
the speakers are reporting events they experienced with painful immediacy and
with regard to which there are no more authoritative sources than themselves.

In addition to indicating increases in evidence strength, -ik and -iki, in com-
bination with -mI , generally correspond to increases in strength of assertion. A
-m-ik assertion is interpreted as stronger than a -mI-ø assertion; a -m-iki asser-
tion as stronger still. In Spanish, -mI-ø generally has no reflex in translation.
More than anything else, it serves to mark comment or focus (see §7.11) or else
to stand in for the copular verb ka, defective in the third-person present tense
(see §4.2.3). In contrast, -m-iki does have a reflex in Spanish: it translates with an
emphatic, either pues ‘then’ or sí ‘yes’. So, quni-m-ø [warm-evd-ø] receives the
Spanish translation ‘es caliente’ ‘it’s warm’; in contrast, quni-m-iki [warm-evd-
ki] receives the translations, ‘es caliente, pues’ ‘it’s warm, then’ or‘sí, es caliente
‘yes, it’s warm’. Example (3) is taken from a story. An old lady has sent two boys
for wood – “so I can cook you a nice supper,” she said. Two doves appear at the
wood pile to warn the boys. Miku-shunki-m-iki ‘she’s going to eat you’, they
warn. Using the -iki form, the birds make the strongest assertion they can. They
need to convince the boys that they are indeed in trouble – their very lives are
in danger.

eat-3>2.fut-evd-iki

In those cases in which -mI takes scope over universal-deontic-modal or future-
tense verbs, -k and -ki do not generally indicate an increase in evidence strength;
rather, they indicate increasingly strong obligations and increasingly immediate
futures, respectively. So, for example, under the scope of -mI-ø, yanapa-na-y
[help-nmlz-1] receives a weak universal deontic interpretation, ‘I ought to help’.
In contrast, under the scope of -m-ik or -m-iki, the same phrase receives increas-
ingly strong universal interpretations, on the order of ‘I have to help’ and ‘I must

318

B.2 TheEM’sandtheinterpretationofpropositionsunderconjectural-trI

help’, respectively. Under the scope of -mI-ø, the phrase is understood as some-
thing like a strong suggestion, while under -m-iki, it is understood as a more
urgent obligation. That is, here, -ik and -iki seem to do something like increase
the degree of modal force, turning a weak universal modal into a strong one.
This is the case, too, where -mI takes scope over future-tense verbs. For example,
explain consultants, in the case of the future-tense ri-shaq [go-1.fut] ‘I will go’,
a speaker might use-mI-ø if she were going to go at some unspecified, possibly
very distant future time. In contrast, she might use -m-ik if her going were immi-
nent, and -m-iki if she were already on her way. The speaker of (4), for example,
urgently needed to water her garden and had been on her way to do just that
when she got caught up in the conversation. When she uttered (4) she was, in
fact, already in motion.

B.2 The EM’s and the interpretation of propositions under

conjectural -trI

In the case of the conjectural -trI , all three forms, -trI-ø, -tri-k, and -tri-ki, indicate
that the speaker has either direct or reportative evidence for a set of propositions,
P, and that the speaker is conjecturing from P to p, the proposition immediately
under the scope of the evidential. The -ik and -iki forms then indicate increases
in the strength of the speaker’s evidence and generally correspond to increases
in certainty of conjecture.

In case a verb under its scope is not already modalized or not already specified
for modal force or conversational base by virtue of its morphology, -trI assigns
the values [universal] and [epistemic], for force and base, respectively. So, for
example, the progressive present-tense kama-ta awa-ya-n [blanket-acc weave-
prog-3] ‘is weaving a blanket’ and the simple past-tense wañu-rqa-ø [die-pst-3]
‘died’, both unmodalized and therefore necessarily not specified for either modal
force or conversational base, receive universal epistemic interpretations under
the scope of -trI : ‘he would/must be weaving a blanket’ and ‘he would/must
have died’, respectively. Speakers bilingual in Yauyos and Spanish consistently
translate and simple-present- and simple-past-tense verbs under the scope of

319

B Furtheranalysisofevidentialmodifiers

-trI with the future and future perfect, respectively. The awa-ya-n ‘is weaving’
and wañu-rqa-ø ‘died’ of the examples immediately above are translated estará
tejiendo and habrá muerto, respectively. In English, ‘would’ and ‘must’ will have
to do the job.

Present-tense conditional verbs in syq may receive at least existential ability,
circumstantial, deontic, epistemic and teleological interpretations. Past-tense
conditional verbs may, in addition to these, also receive universal deontic and
epistemic interpretations. That is, present-tense conditionals are specified for
modal force [existential], but not modal base, while past-tense conditionals are
specified for neither force nor base. -trI restricts the interpretation of condition-
als, generally excluding all but epistemic readings. In the case of past-tense con-
ditionals, it generally excludes all but universal readings, as well. For example,
although the present-tense conditional of (1), saya-ru-chuwan ‘we could stand
around’, is normally five-ways ambiguous, under the scope of -trI , only the exis-
tential epistemic reading available: ‘it could happen that we stand around’. Sim-
ilarly, although the past-tense conditional of (2), miku-ra-ma-n-man ka-rqa-ø
‘could/would/should/might have eaten me’, is normally seven-ways ambiguous,
under the scope of -trI , only the universal epistemic reading is available: ‘the
Devil would necessarily have eaten me’. The context for (1) – a discussion of
women and alcohol – supports the epistemic reading. The speaker, a woman
who in her eighty-odd years had never taken alcohol, was speculating on what
would happen if women were to drink. Her conclusion: it’s possible we would
stand around naked, going crazy.

If it is the case, as Copley (2009) argue, and Matthewson, Rullmann & Davis
(2005) that the future tense is a modal specified for both force, [universal], and

320

B.2 TheEM’sandtheinterpretationofpropositionsunderconjectural-trI

base, [metaphysical] or [circumstantial], -trI should have no effect on the inter-
pretation of mode in the case of future-tense verbs. This is indeed the case. For
example, both the tiya-pa-ru-wa-nga of (3) and ashna-ku-lla-shaq of (4) receive
exactly the interpretations they would have were they not under the scope of
-trI: ‘they will accompany me sitting’ and ‘I’m going to stink’, respectively. This
does not mean that -trI-ø/ik/iki has no effect on the interpretation of future-tense
verbs, however. Although it leaves tam interpretation unaffected, -trI continues
to indicate that the proposition under its scope is a conjecture. And -ik and
-iki, as they do in conjunction with -mI , indicate increasingly immediate or cer-
tain futures. So, although the tam interpretations of (3)’s tiya-pa-ru-wa-nga ‘will
accompany me sitting’ and (4)’s ashna-ku-lla-shaq ‘I’m going to stink’ are un-
changed under the scope of -trI , the -ik of the first and the -iki of the second
signal immediate and certain futures, respectively. In (3), that future was about
an hour away: it was 6 o’clock and the those who were to accompany the speaker
were expected at 7:00 for a healing ceremony. The context for (4), too, was a heal-
ing ceremony. The speaker was referring to the upcoming part of the ceremony
in which she would have to wash with putrid urine – certain to make anyone
stink!

In those cases in which -ik and -iki modify -trI , they generally correspond to
increases in certainty of conjecture: a -tr-ik conjecture is interpreted as more cer-
tain than a -trI ø conjecture; and a -tr-iki conjecture is interpreted as more certain
still. Recall that under the scope of -trI , present-tense conditional verbs gener-
ally receive existential epistemic interpretations while past-tense-conditional as
well as simple-present- and simple-past-tense verbs generally receive universal
epistemic interpretations. In the case of the first, -k and -ki yield increasingly

321

B Furtheranalysisofevidentialmodifiers

strong possibility readings; in the case of the second, third and fourth, increas-
ingly strong necessity readings. So, under the scope of trI-ø, the present-tense
conditional wañu-ru-n-man [die-urgt-3-cond] ‘could die’ receives something
like a weak possibility reading; under -tr-iki, in contrast, the same phrase re-
ceives something like a strong possibility reading. Consultants explain that the
-ø form might be used in a situation where the person was sick but it remained to
be seen whether he would die; the -iki form, in contrast, might be used in a situa-
tion where the person was gravely ill and far more likely to die. Similarly, under
the scope of -trI-ø, the simple past tense wañu-rqa-ø [die-pst-3] ‘died’ would re-
ceive something like a weak necessity reading: it is highly probable but not com-
pletely certain that the person died. In contrast, under the scope of -tr-iki, the
same phrase would receive something like a strong necessity reading: it is very
highly probable, indeed, virtually certain, that the person died. Consultants ex-
plain that a speaker might use -ø form if she knew, say, that the person, who had
been very sick, still had not returned two months after having been transported
down the mountain to a hospital in Lima. In contrast, that same speaker might
use the -iki form if she had, additionally, say, heard funeral bells ringing and
seen two of person’s daughters crying in the church. (5) and (6) give naturally-
occurring examples. In (5), the speakeri makes a present-tense conditional -trI-ø
conjecture: Shej could possibly be with a soul (i.e., accompanied by the spirit of
a recently deceased relative). The speaker made this conjecture after hearing the
report of a single piece of evidence – that a calf had spooked when shej came
near. Surely, whether or not a person is walking around with the spirit of a re-
cently dead relative hovering somewhere close by is a hard thing to judge, even
with an accumulation of evidence. In this case, only the weak -ø form is licensed.
In (6), in contrast, the speaker makes a simple-present-tense -tr-iki conjecture: A
certain calf (a friend’s) must be being weaned. The speaker, having spent all but
a half dozen of her 70-odd years raising goats, sheep, cows and alpacas, would
not just be making an educated guess as to whether a calf was being weaned. She
knows the signs. In this situation, the strong -iki form is licensed.

In sum, Yauyos’ three evidentials, -mI , shI , and -trI , each has three variants,
formed by the affixation of three evidential modifiers, -ø, -ik, and -iki. The EM’s
are ordered on a cline of strength, with the -ik and -iki forms generally indicating
progressively stronger evidence. With the direct -mI , this then generally corre-
sponds to progressively stronger assertions; with the conjectural -trI , to progres-
sively more certain conjectures. In the case of verbs receiving universal-deontic-
modal or future-tense interpretations, -k and -ki indicate stronger obligations
and more imminent futures, respectively. -trI has the prior effect of changing the
modal interpretation of the verbs under its scope. In case a verb under its scope
is not already already specified for modal force or conversational base by virtue
of its morphology, -trI assigns the default values [universal] and [epistemic] for
force and base, respectively.

B.3 A sociolinguistic note

In a dialogue, -ø(φ) will often be answered with -ik(φ) or -iki(φ), where φ is a
propostition-evidential pair. Thus, Karu-m-ø ‘it’s far’ may be answered with Aw,
karu-mi-ki ‘Yes, you got it/that’s right/you bet you/ummhunn/, it’s far’. In (1),
the first speaker makes a -trI-ø conjecture, ‘They must have left drunk’. The sec-
ond answers with -tr-ik, echoing the judgement of the first, ‘Indeed, they must
have gotten drunk’.

Quechua

This book presents a synchronic grammar of the southern dialects of
Yauyos, an extremely endangered Quechuan language spoken in the Pe-
ruvian Andes. As the language is highly synthetic, the grammar focuses
principally on morphology; a longer section is dedicated to the language’s
unusual evidential system. The grammar’s 1400 examples are drawn from
a 24-hour corpus of transcribed recordings collected in the course of the
documentation of the language.
