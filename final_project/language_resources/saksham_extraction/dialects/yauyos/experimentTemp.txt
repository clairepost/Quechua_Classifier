3 Substantives
3.2 Substantive classes
In syq, as in other Quechuan languages, the class of substantives comprises six
subclasses: nouns,pronouns,interrogative-indefinites,adjectives,pre-adjectives,
and numerals. §3.2.1–3.2.5 cover each of these in turn. Multiple-class substan-
tives and the dummy nounna are covered in §3.2.6 and 3.2.7, respectively.
3.2.1 Nouns
The class of nouns may be divided into four sub-classes: regular nouns (wayta
‘flower’), time nouns (kanan ‘now’), gender nouns (tiya ‘aunt’), and locative
nouns (qipa ‘behind’). §3.2.1.1–3.2.1.4 cover each of these in turn.
3.2.1.1 Regular nouns
The class of regular nouns includes all nouns not included in the other three
classes. Although in this sense it is defined negatively, as a kind of default class,
it includes by far more members than any of the others. (1–5) give examples.
