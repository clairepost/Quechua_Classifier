Huaylas (Ancash) Quechua  
Carlos Molina-Vital 
4.1 General information 
Huaylas Quechua (HQ) [ISO 639-3 qwh, Glottocode huay1240], is a dialect of the Ancash 
Quechua language ottocode huay1239]. People refer to this language mostly as qichwa. Only a 
few people call their language nunashimi ‘language of the people.’  
The Huaylas variety of Ancash Quechua is one of the best described Central Quechua 
varieties, and has been studied particularly during the initial period of modern Andean linguistics 
(e.g. Parker 1967 and 1973a). Before that point, HQ terms were included, albeit not 
systematically, in the first Quechua grammar and lexicon by Domingo de Santo Tomás (1560a). 
Its author served as a priest in Yungay, and some terms from this variety of Ancash Quechua, 
known then as the Chinchaysuyo language, appeared in those foundational works. Another 
colonial source is the 1700 reedition of Torres Rubio’s Arte de la lengua Quichua (1st ed. 1619). 
There, Juan de Figueredo supplements the original, a description of Cuzco Quechua, with a list 
of lexical items and phrases from what is mainly, but not exclusively, an Ancash Quechua 
variety (Cerrón-Palomino 1987: 89). More than 200 years later, the Vocabulario Poliglota 
Incaico (1905) included Ancash Quechua alongside the Quechuan languages from Cuzco, 
Ayacucho, and Junín. However, the Ancash variety it documented was the Southern Conchucos 
one, from the Huari province (Cerrón-Palomino 1987: 386). 
 
4.1.1 Geography, environment, and economics 
During early colonial times, administrative documents already attested the widespread presence 
of the two ethnic groups who spoke the main dialects of Ancash Quechua: the Huaylas and the 
Conchucos (Chirinos 2001: 54). The Huaylas variety is spoken along the Callejón de Huaylas 
(lit. “Huaylas alley”) region, a stretch of temperate inter-Andean valleys located between the 
eastern Cordillera Blanca (“white-mountain range”) and the western Cordillera Negra (“black-
mountain range”). This fertile area is irrigated by the Santa river, which runs northwards from its 
origin in the Conococha Lake in the southern province of Bolognesi. This river steadily lowers in 
altitude across the whole Callejón de Huaylas, which makes the northern provinces’ valleys 
warmer in climate. From north to south, the following provinces comprise this region: Huaylas, 
Yungay, Carhuaz, Huaraz, and Recuay.1 The capital of the region and center of the 
administrative and political power is the city of Huaraz (population 118,836 in 2017).  
Economically, the Callejón de Huaylas is very productive and diverse. Due to the 
beautiful ice-capped peaks in the Cordillera Blanca and its many glacial lakes, it is one of the 
most visited destinations in Peru. However, more traditionally, this region is an important center 
for production of tubers and corn (for internal consumption and to supply the city of Lima), as 
well as fruits and flowers (particularly blueberries). It also has a significant milk production in 
the lower altitude provinces. Intensive mining of silver, copper, and zinc has changed the social 
dynamics between Quechua communities, the Peruvian Government, and mining corporations. 
 
4.1.2 Speaker population and endangerment  
 
1 Julca Guerrero (2010: 280) indicates that the Huaylas variety includes also a Huaylas-Vertientes variety spoken in 
the areas right outside of the Callejón de Huaylas, specifically the vertientes or areas located along the western 
slopes of the Black Mountain Range. This grammatical sketch does not include data from the Huaylas-Vertientes 
variety, only from the one spoken in the Callejón de Huaylas. 
Ancash Quechua, as a whole, is the largest Central Quechua dialectal area in terms of speakers. 
It is spoken by no more than 900,000 people (Pozzi-Escot 1998; Julca Guerrero 2010). However, 
among them, the majority speak the northern and southern Conchucos variety, which is one of 
the most vital Quechua varieties in Peru when it comes to number of speakers (approx. 161,000 
according to Ethnologue 2022) and transmission rates. The 2017 census shows that the lowest 
percentage of speakers for that variety is at 79,92% in Huari, and the highest at 92,54% for 
Mariscal Luzuriaga (Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática 2018). In comparison, HQ 
appears to be a threatened variety. Its total number of speakers has declined since 1940, when 
80% of the population was Quechua-speaking (Julca Guerrero 2010: 63). However, HQ can be 
considered a vital language. Children still learn it and most provinces in this region display a 
clear majority of speakers learning it before Spanish. Table 1 summarizes the findings of the 
2017 National Census regarding number of speakers in the provinces where this variety is 
spoken. 
 
<insert Table 4.1 here> 
 
The total number of speakers of a Quechuan language who are five  years and older in the 
provinces where HQ is present is approximately 139,543. It must be noticed that this number 
does not represent the actual amount of HQ speakers, but an approximation. This is because 
Quechua speakers in the eastern districts in the provinces of Huaylas (parts of Yuracmarca, Santa 
Cruz, and Caraz), Yungay (Yanama), and Carhuaz (San Miguel de Aco) belong to the 
Conchucos variety of Ancash Quechua.2 Besides Julca Guerrero’s (2010) comprehensive 
dialectological survey of this region, little work has been done for those specific varieties.3 
The presence of Quechua speakers is strong in many small rural towns located along 
ravines and ridges between 2,100 and 3,000 masl. There it is still possible to find monolingual 
speakers of the Huaylas dialect. They tend to be elderly men and women, but if younger, it is 
almost exclusively women who remain monolingual. This is due to their more conservative 
economic role. Also, women still make up most of the illiterate population in the Central Andes, 
due to traditional prejudice against their education (cf. Julca Guerrero 2010: 270–7). In any case, 
it is evident that HQ is threatened by the widespread use of Spanish (Menacho López and Villari 
2019). 
 
4.2 Internal variation and classification 
Ancash Quechua has been divided in four dialectal zones. Several studies (Torero 1974; Parker 
1976; Landerman 1991; Julca Guerrero 2010) agree in dividing it in two main varieties, Huaylas 
and Conchucos, and two minor ones, the Sihuas-Corongo, and the Bolognesi-Vertientes dialects. 
Within HQ, based on phonological, morphological, and lexical differences, Julca 
Guerrero (2010) distinguishes two areas: Southern and Northern Huaylas. The Southern variety 
is spoken in the high-altitude regions of the Callejón de Huaylas, in Recuay, Huaraz, and the 
southern extreme of Carhuaz, in the Marcará district, delimited by river of the same name, and 
 
2 Since the beginning of the 21st century, the Conchucos variety has been object of several specific studies by Daniel 
Hintz (2011, 2020),  Diane Hintz (2003, 2006, 2007), and both together (Hintz and Hintz 2017). They have covered 
aspect, tense, modality, word order, and evidentiality. 
3 An exception is the work of Francisco Carranza Romero (1979, 1998, 2003). He has produced several works based 
on his native Quechua variety spoken in Quitaracsa, a village located in the Yuracmarca district, on the north-eastern 
slopes of the Huaylas province. While the information in Carranza Romero (2003) shows that this variety is closer to 
the northern Conchucos one, it still has many lexical and syntactic commonalities with the Huaylas variety. 
the Huasca Urán ravine. This dialectal zone also includes the communities located in the 
highlands of Carhuaz and Yungay, above 3,500 masl.   
The Northern variety is spoken in the lower parts of the Callejón de Huaylas, in the 
provinces of Huaylas, Yungay, and Carhuaz (with the exception of its southernmost part). Its 
northern boundary is the area where the Cordillera Blanca and the Cordillera Negra meet: The 
Cañón del Pato (“Duck Canyon”), where the Santa river splits the mountains moving westwards 
into the Corongo and Santa provinces. 
Based on phonological isoglosses,4 Southern and Northern HQ can be clearly 
distinguished because in the former the glottal fricative /h/ is used in word initial position, while 
in the latter that segment has disappeared in that position. Thus, hirka ‘mountain’ and hatun ‘big’ 
in Southern Huaylas correspond to irka and atun, without initial [h], in Northern Huaylas.  
In addition to this, there are alternations for words that can be reconstructed with Proto- 
Quechua */s/ in word-initial position. Thus, reconstructed forms such as *sacha ‘tree,’ *samay 
‘to breathe,’ and *saqiy ‘to leave (something)’ became hacha, hamay, and haqiy in Southern 
Huaylas, and acha, amay, and aqiy in Northern Huaylas, where reduction of sibilants to Ø 
operates. However, it must be noticed that in both HQ varieties many terms maintain /s/ in word-
initial position. For instance, sutay ‘to pull,’ siqiy ‘to bring down,’ and suwa ‘thieve’ are 
rendered with an initial [s] in all of HQ. 
Finally, the other sibilant, the alveopalatal fricative *sh, has experienced irregular 
changes in the Huaylas variety. For instance, shuti ‘name’ and shutu ‘drip’ are produced with 
their initial [ʃ] in the Northern Huaylas variety, but they are huti and hutu in the Southern one 
(Julca Guerrero 2010: 153–4). The retention of /sh/ for those words in the northern dialect goes 
against its tendency towards the lenition and eventual suppression of sibilants. Conversely, other 
terms that show Proto Quechua *sh became Ø in Northern Huaylas. *shiqta ‘mustard’ and *shuk 
‘one’ became itka and uk in that variety, while in the southern one the initial segment changed 
into /h/ (Julca Guerrero 2010: 155). 
 
4.3 Phonology and Phonotactics 
HQ has one of the most innovative phonologies within Central Quechua. Three distinctive sound 
changes in this variety are (i) diphthongs that result in monophthongization as long vowels and, 
in some cases, middle long vowels (e.g. /aw/ → [oː], /ay/ → [eː]), (ii) the existence of a voiceless 
alveolar affricate /ʦ/ contrasting with a voiceless alveopalatal fricative /ch/ (e.g. tsaqa ‘dawn, 
dusk’ and chaqa ‘cup made of a gourd’), and (iii) widespread depalatalization of */ñ/ into 
alveodental /n/ (e.g. *ñawi ‘eyes’ > nawi). 
 
4.3.1 Vowels 
The system of three phonological vowels (/i/, /a/ and /u/), common to every Quechuan language, 
is at the basis of HQ. However, as is the case for Central Quechua varieties, the full set of vowels 
also includes their corresponding long forms (/iː/, /aː/, and /uː/). Due to the continuous contact 
with Spanish, which led to widespread bilingualism between that language and HQ, it is common 
to find speakers who produce mid vowels like [e], [eː], and [o] with full regularity when using 
 
4 Relevant morphological isoglosses will be pointed out when specific suffixes are introduced in this grammatical 
sketch. By way of illustration of lexical differences, Northern Huaylas speakers say alla;pi ‘much,’ which is alla:pa 
in the Southern variety. Likewise, ‘dirty’ is qacha in Northern Huaylas and rakcha or taqra in the South, while ‘to 
dance’ is tushuy in the North and qatsway in the South. 
loans from Spanish. In any case, the native HQ vowel system has six vowels between short and 
long ones. The following table provides the inventory.5 
 
<insert table 4.2 here> 
 
The high vowels /i/ and /u/ tend to have a lax mid-high realization close to [ɪ] and [ʊ], 
respectively. As in other Quechuan languages, the presence of the post-velar stop /q/ brings out a 
coarticulation process by which high vowels are produced like mid-vowels [e] and [o] or mid-
open vowels [ɛ] and [ɔ] respectively. Thus tsiqlla ‘waist’ becomes ['ʦɛqʎa] and shunqu ‘heart’ 
becomes ['ʃɔŋqɔ]. Notice that sonorant consonants (approximants, nasals, liquids, and rhotics) in 
between /q/ and a high vowel are no obstacle to the lowering process. This can be seen in tsiwqa 
['ʦɛwqa] ‘teapot,’ sinqa ['ʃɛŋqa] ‘nose,’ ullqu ['ɔʎqɔ] ‘male,’ and murqu ['mɔrqɔ] ‘rusty.’ 
Compared to Southern Quechua varieties, HQ sibilants appear to block vowel lowering (e.g. 
isqun ‘nine’ is mostly ['isqɔn]). Also, /i/ and /u/ are not always lowered in word-final position, 
something quite common in Southern Quechua. Moreover, some speakers do not lower them 
significantly even right after /q/ at the end of the word (thus, it is possible to hear ['ʃɔŋqʊ] for 
shunqu ‘heart’). 
Short vowels in HQ (like in other Central Quechua varieties), can be clearly perceived as 
shorter than their unstressed Spanish counterparts. This seems to be even more pronounced with 
/a/, the least similar vowel to its Spanish equivalent, particularly in syllable-final, word-final and 
before /m/ (Swisshelm 1971: 19; Parker 1976: 50–1). 
Long vowels in HQ have an uneven distribution. In my corpus of approximately 100,000 
words, /aː/ is found 16,149 times, while /iː/ and /uː/ only 2,375 and 423 times, respectively. Long 
vowels can open or close a syllable, but they never appear before a consonant in the same 
syllable. In other words, syllables ending in consonant only accept short vowels. Consequently, 
some roots or suffixes ending in a long vowel will frequently be rendered with a short one (e.g. 
puri-yka:-lla-n ‘he is just walking’ will shorten the continuous aspect marker -yka: in puri-yka-n 
‘he is walking’). Also, long vowels are seldom found in word initial position. When this 
happens, it is either in a Spanish loan or a word based on onomatopoeia (specifically /a:/ 
expressing agreement, assertion, or an affirmative answer). In any case, there are (near) minimal 
pairs showing the phonological status of long vowels. 
 
<insert table 4.3 here> 
 
The particularly short quality of /i/, /a/, and /u/ can be considered the main reason why Spanish 
loans that are fully incorporated into HQ use a long vowel corresponding to the one in the 
stressed syllable in the source. Table 3 includes i:gus, a clear loan from Spanish higo ‘fig.’ Other 
examples are caballo ‘horse,’ rendered as kawa:llu, and puro ‘pure,’ which is employed by as 
pu:ru and functions as an augmentative modifier similar to ‘very.’ 
 
5 The official orthography for Quechuan languages spoken in Peru has been establishe d through the Decree N. 1218-
85-ED, issued on November 18th, 1985 by the Ministry of Education. The official orthography differs from the one 
used in this volume only in that long vowels are represented with a colon (<a:>, <i:>, <u:>), instead of double 
vowels (<aa>, <ii>, <uu>). Also, sounds that come from Spanish loans are written with their corresponding Spanish 
consonant if it is one not available in the native HQ inventory. Regarding Spanish vowels, loans are written using 
the native three-vowel system, including lengthening for stressed Spanish vowels, only if present in the corpus 
source. For instance zapato ‘shoe’ will be rendered sapatu, and vida ‘life’ will be bida. See Table 4.4 for the 
consonant inventory. 
 
4.3.2 Consonants 
As can be seen in Table 4.4, HQ has 17 phonemic consonants in its native inventory. In addition 
to those, five more consonants originating from Spanish loans are also considered (included 
between parentheses): 
 
<insert Table 4.4 here> 
 
While most of the native consonant sounds are fairly similar to the Proto-Quechua inventory, 
some changes have occurred. Perhaps the most noticeable is the change from the Proto-Quechua 
voiceless alveopalatal fricative */ch/ (also represented as /č/ in the Quechuanist literature) into 
the current voiceless alveolar affricate /ts/. This sound contrasted in Proto-Quechua with the 
voiceless retroflex affricate */ćh/ (usually represented as /ĉ/ in the literature). Furthermore, the 
latter sound lost its retroflex manner of articulation and became the alveopalatal affricate /ch/. 
Thus, Proto-Quechua pairs like *chaki ‘dry’ and *ćhaki ‘feet’ became respectively ʦaki and 
chaki in HQ. 
It is also worth noticing that HQ tends to keep /p/, /t/, /k/, and /q/ as stops in syllable final 
position (i.e. they do not turn into a fricative). This can be heard in words like qapchi ['qapʧɪ] 
‘thin,’ putka ['pʊtka] ‘turbid,’ tikpi ['tɪkpɪ] ‘pin,’ and suqpi ['soqpɪ] ‘loosely tied.’  
Also, /r̝/, a raised postalveolar non-sonorant trill (traditionally represented with /ř/ in the 
literature), is used to represent loans using the Spanish voiced alveolar trill (e.g. carro ‘car’ is 
rendered as /'kar̝ʊ/). This is fairly standard in Quechuan languages. 
The alveolar nasal /n/ has a rather restricted distribution as an alveolar. Only at the 
beginning of a syllable it is produced as [n], e.g. nina ['nina] ‘fire’ or nana ['nana] ‘pain.’ Also, 
likely to be a case of assimilation of point of articulation, /n/ remains [n] before the alveolar 
sounds /t/, /s/, and /ʦ/ and the alveolo-palatal affricate /ch/. Before /p/, /n/ assimilates to a bilabial 
nasal [m], e.g. mamanpis [ma'mampɪs] ‘also her mother.’ Likewise, before the velar and uvular 
plosives /k/ and /q/ it takes their point of articulation, e.g. yunka ['jʊŋka] ‘coast,’ qunqay 
['qoɴqaj] ‘to forget.’ However, in several contexts where a conditioning environment for 
assimilation of the point of articulation is not apparent, /n/ is rendered as the velar nasal [ŋ]. This 
can be seen before other nasals, e.g. pupunmi [pʊ'pʊŋmɪ] ‘his navel (I know)’, laterals, e.g. 
pupunlla [pʊ'pʊŋʎa] ‘just his navel,’ rhotics, e.g. rinri [‘ɾɪŋɾɪ] ‘ears,’ and semiconsonants, e.g. 
warminwan [waɾ'mɪŋwaŋ] ‘with his wife,’ tsunyaq ['ʦʊŋjaq] ‘uninhabited.’ Also, in word final 
position, /n/ becomes [ŋ], e.g. tamyan ['tamyaŋ] ‘it rains.’ To sum up, alongside the 
crosslinguistically well-known rule that assimilates a nasal’s point of articulation to that of the 
following obstruent (e.g. /np/ → [mp]), there seems to be another rule that connects the velar 
allophone [ŋ] with the continuous emission of airflow that characterizes sonorants and the 
syllable final position.  
Finally, HQ has undergone a process of depalatalization of nasals (*ñ > /n/) and, to a 
much lesser extent, lateral segments (*/ll/> /l/). Thus, the palatal nasal /ñ/ in syllable-initial 
position has become /n/ for many lexemes throughout the Callejón de Huaylas. However, the 
change is not complete for those segments. In particular, it is not clear what conditions the 
change from *ñ into /n. For instance, older forms like ñawi ‘eye’ or ñaña ‘sister (of a woman)’ 
have completely depalatalized in HQ and are nawi and nana. However, piña ‘angry’ and mañay 
‘to request,’ among many others, remain palatalized. Still, there seems to be a distinction 
between Southern Huaylas, where depalatalization is more widespread, and Northern Huaylas, 
where forms with palatalized nasals alternate with their depalatalized equivalents (Julca Guerrero 
2010: 121).  
 
4.3.3 Syllable structure, root structure; and phonotactic constraints 
Syllable structure in HQ does not differ from the typical Quechuan one. A vowel is always the 
head, and it can be a syllable on its own (V), e.g. upa /u.'pa/ ‘deaf.’ The most frequent 
combination is that of a consonant in the onset (CV), e.g. pununa /pu.'nu.na/ ‘bed.’ More 
uncommon, but still widely present, are syllables with just a consonant coda (VC), e.g. uchpa 
‘ashes,’ and ones with two consonants surrounding the vowel (CVC), e.g. atuq ‘fox.’6 Notice 
that this syllable structure excludes CCV syllables. Thus, Spanish loans following that pattern 
are incorporated into HQ without the initial consonant (e.g. Spanish plátano ‘banana’ becomes 
latanus /la.ta.'nus/).  
The semiconsonants /y/ and /w/ behave like consonants for syllable structure. Thus upyay 
‘to drink’ includes a CVC syllable at the end, and wawqi ‘brother (of a man)’ one at the 
beginning. 
As is customary for Quechuan languages, two vowels cannot appear contiguously, 
neither in the same or different syllables. This is the reason why several words that can be 
reconstructed with an internal */s/ in Proto-Quechua ended up with a semiconsonant in HQ, e.g. 
*pusaq ‘eight’ > /'pu.haq/ > /'pu.waq/, *wasi ‘house’ > /'wa.hi/ > /wa.yi/). 
 
4.3.4 Important morphophonological processes 
4.3.4.1 Syllable structure and the suffix -ni ‘epenthetic (EP)’ 
If a suffix starting with a (semi)consonant is added to a stem ending also in a (semi)consonant, 
then a prohibited same-syllable CC sequence occurs. For instance, if yawar ‘blood’ were to 
take -yki ‘2.POSS’ directly, it would yield impossible sequences such as *['ja.wa.rj.kɪ], 
*['ja.war.j.kɪ], or *['ja.war.jkɪ], with CC, C, and CCV sequences respectively. To solve this, an 
empty-meaning suffix -ni is inserted as a “hinge” that helps restructure the syllable structure 
avoiding the forbidden sequences. Thus ‘your blood’ is expressed as yawarniyki with a syllabic 
structure /ja.war.'nij.ki/. 
Notice that long vowels in HQ are considered consonants for syllabic structure. 
Consequently, following the monophthongization rules (see Section 4.3.4.1) llumtsuy ‘daughter 
in law’ is pronounced ['ʎumʦiː] with a long vowel at the end. If we were going to say ‘my 
daughter in law’ the 1st person possessive is marked by lengthening the last vowel in the root. 
This would lead to the impossible form *['ʎumʦiːː]. Instead, -ni is introduced to produce 
llumtsi:ni: /'ʎumʦiːniː/.  
 
4.3.4.1 Monophthongization 
Perhaps the most innovative phonological process in HQ is the reduction of virtually all 
diphthongs into long vowels, i.e. monophthongization. This process was explicitly reported in 
early works for this variety (Parker 1967; Escribens and Proulx 1970; Swisshelm 1971), and it is 
currently dominant throughout the Callejón de Huaylas (Julca Guerrero 2010: 126); it is thus at a 
more advanced stage than similar monophthongization processes in Chachapoyas Quechua (see 
 
6 Swisshelm (1971: 141–4) correctly noticed that /n/ and /s/ could be syllable heads in the final syllable. Thus, 
waqara:kun ‘she keeps crying’ can be rendered as [wa.qa.'ɾa:.kŋ], and nuqapis ‘me too’ as [no.'qa.ps]. This seems 
to be restricted to fast speech. 
Chapter 7 by Jairo Valqui and Aviva Shimelman in this volume). Table 4.5 illustrates the 
instances of monophthongization and their contexts. 
 
 
<Insert Table 4.5 here> 
 
The first instance of monophthongization is the most widespread one: /ay/ → [eː]. Since the 60s 
it has been reported in lexemes and suffixes. The second instance, /aw/ → [oː], was reported as 
having restrictions such as a preference to occur in suffixes (e.g. the locative -chaw and the 
simulative -naw) and after palatal segments and /p/ (Parker 1976: 53‒4). However, the process 
now is consummated through the region at the lexeme level (Julca Guerrero 2010: 128‒9). 
Finally, the change /uy/ → [iː] is the most restricted one among the speakers of HQ. Specifically, 
monophthongization occurs when /y/ is the first segment in a suffix (e.g. infinitive -y, imperative 
-y, emphatic perfective -yku, continuous -yka:, and second person nominal -yki). However, this is 
not always the case, particularly in the Northern Huaylas variety where, according to Julca 
Guerrero (2010) the diphthong is still present. Furthermore, expansion into lexemes is still very 
restricted. Julca Guerrero (2010: 132) only found two lexemes showing monophthongization: 
llumtsuy ‘daughter in law’ and luychu ‘deer,’ but not consistently in the region.7 
 
4.3.4.3 Vowel lowering in derivational morphology 
Verbal derivational suffixes ending on /i/ or /u/ undergo a lowering process that turn their high 
vowel into [a]. This happens when those suffixes are followed by a member of the set of 
“triggering” suffixes: these include the cislocative/translocative suffix -mu, the causative suffix -
tsi, the 1st person object suffix -ma:, and the benefactive suffix -pu.8 Triggering suffixes, with 
the exception of -pu, which does lower to -pa, do not undergo vowel lowering themselves. Some 
contrasting examples are in (1).  
 
(1) a.  Rika:rin. 
{rika:-ri-n}  
see-PUNC-3.SBJ 
‘S/he sees briefly.’  
b. Rika:ramun. 
{rika:-ri-mu-n}  
see-PUNC-CISL-3.SBJ 
 
7 A related phenomenon is that the sequence /iy/ sometimes produces [i:] but most of the times is resolved as [i]. 
Thus, yaskiykuy /yas'kiykuy/ ‘answer, please’ is mostly produced as [jas'kikuj] and seldom as [jas'kiːkuj]. 
8 Parker (1973a: 40, 1976: 130) claimed that in HQ lowering effects were triggered also by the imperfective 
suffix -yka:, which lowers -ri and -pu; and by the reflexive suffix -ku, which lowers -pu. Those claims are incorrect. 
Regarding -yka:, Parker does not acknowledge the frequent combination of the durative suffix -ra: and the 
continuous -yka:, which due to shortening of low vowels followed by a consonant coda, is rendered as -rayka:. It is 
clear that this instance of -ra does not come from the punctual aspect suffix -ri. The lowering of -pu to -pa is more 
problematic. Parker suggests that -yka: and -ku lower -pa. However, neither -yka: nor -ku have been reported as a 
trigger suffix in other Central Quechua varieties, which casts doubts on that analysis. However, the main reason to 
reject the lowering of -pu before -ku or -yka: in HQ is that all the cases found in the corpus illustrate cases of -pa 
where this suffix has a different function from -pu: the latter is a benefactive, while the former could be a either 
general applicative that freely alternates with -pa:, or the first segment of the suffix -paku, which is cognate with the 
applicative (see Section 4.6.2.2.6 for the applicative suffix -pa: and Section 4.6.2.3.5 for -paku.)

  ‘They see briefly.’ 
 b. Rika:raya:mun. 
  {rika:-ri-ya:-mu-n}

  ‘They come see briefly.’ 
 
Also, the trigger suffix can affect a string of derivational suffixes. For instance, in Example (6), 
has -rpu, -rku, and -ri affected by -mu.

 {hiqa-rpu-rku-ri-mu-pti-n} 
 grow-DW-UW-PUNC-CISL-SUBDS-3.SBJ 
‘when it has germinated fully’ (lit. ‘when it grows downwards and upwards,’ like a plant 
does when it germinates) 
 
 
4.3.5 Stress assignment 
At the word level, the penultimate syllable is most generally stressed (as it is the norm for other 
Quechuan languages). Thus, adding suffixes will not displace stress from that position (e.g. pu-
sha-n /'pu.shan/ ‘he guides’ and pu-sha-lla-n /pu.'sha.llan/ ‘he just guides’). 
However, there are several cases in which the primary accent does not fall on the 
penultimate syllable. First, toponyms ending in /n/ consistently display final stress (e.g. Tuspín 
/tus.'pin/, Parón /pa.r'un/, Huancapetí /wan.ka.pi.'ti/). Julca Guerrero (2009: 142‒3) provides 
evidence for short vowels in a final stressed syllable originally coming from unstressed long 
vowels in final position. Other terms alternate between penultimate and final stress, e.g. 
turmanyay /tur.man.'yeː/ or /tur.'man.yeː/ ‘rainbow’ (Swisshelm 1971: 167). Finally, final stress, 
as it is the case in other Quechuan languages, serves as an emotional device: vocatives and 
interjections are frequently associated with that stress pattern, e.g. tayta:! [teː'taː] ‘Sir!,’ alláw! 
[a.'llaw] ‘what a pity!’) 
The most complete analysis of stress patterns in relation with the length of a syllable is in 
Swisshelm (1971: 163–75). His proposal acknowledges several instances where penultimate 
stress does not occur. For instance, he observes that if there is only one long syllable in a word 
(i.e. CVC, VC, Vː, or CVː) and it occurs anywhere before the last syllable, that it will then carry 
the primary stress. Thus, warmi ['waɾ.mi] ‘woman’ or wara:nin [wa.'ɾaː.ni] ‘tomorrow’ follow 
this rule and have penultimate stress, while ampipa ['am.pi.pa] ‘at night’ or hirkakunapa 
['hiɾ.ka.ku.na.pa] ‘through the mountains’ have stress in their initial syllable, the long one. Other 
rules Swisshelm (1971) proposes are that when several syllables before the final one are long, 
then the last one of them will be stressed (e.g. siqaykarinqa [se.qeːka.'ren.qa] ‘he will fall down’ 
or aqaykaqtana [a.qeː.'kaq.ta.na] ‘the one already grinding it’); and if there are no long syllables 
before the final one, then the initial syllable becomes stressed (e.g. suwakuq ['su.wa.kuq] ‘the 
one who steals,’ waraka ['wa.ra.ka] ‘sling’).  
 
4.4 Parts of speech and transcategorical operations 
4.4.1 Parts of speech 
HQ is similar to other Quechuan languages in that it has four types of words: (i) nouns (e.g., 
hirka ‘mountain’), (ii) verbs (e.g., chura- ‘to put’), (iii) ambivalents (e.g. suwa ‘thief’ and 
suwa- ‘to steal’), and particles (e.g., mana ‘not’, hina ‘like, so’). Adjectives can be considered as 
a type of noun, since nothing in their morphosyntactic behavior distinguishes them from nouns. 
In Example (7), for instance, chukru ‘hard’ appears in object function without further 
modification.  
 
(7)  Manam pay chukruta mikuyta puwidintsu. 
{mana-m  pay  chukru-ta  miku-y-ta  puwidi-n-tsu} 
 not-EVD s/he  hard-ACC  eat-INF-ACC  be.able.to-3.SBJ-NEG 
 ‘He can’t eat hard things.’ 
 
Some adjectives come from stative verbal roots (e.g., kushi ‘happy’), while others arise from 
nominalizations, some of which ended up lexicalized. For instance, shumaq ‘pretty’ and mushuq 
‘new’ have clearly lexicalized the agentive nominalizer -q. This is not different from how lasa-q 
‘heavy’ is created from lasa- ‘to weight.’ 
The main formal indicator of wordclasshood is the type of suffixes a root can take. Nouns 
take nominal suffixes (e.g., possessive inflection, plural, case) and verbs take verbal suffixes 
(e.g., tense, person, aspect, voice). Ambivalent roots take nominal or verbal morphology. There 
are also independent suffixes, known traditionally in Quechuan linguistics as enclitics (Cerrón-
Palomino 1987: 287). They convey notions related to the nature of information (e.g., 
evidentials), topic, focus, and other types of (inter)subjective stance. They are important to 
determine parts of speech because they can attach to nouns, verbs, and particles. What 
distinguishes particles is that they only take independent suffixes, never nominal nor verbal ones 
(e.g. mana-m ‘no.’) 
Interjections may be considered another type of word inasmuch as they do not seem to 
take any suffixes, and they have a consistent final-syllable stress pattern (e.g., atatáw ‘how 
ugly!,’ achalláw ‘how pretty!’). 
 
4.4.2 Transcategorical operations 
In order to derive nouns from verbs, HQ uses the following nominalizers: potential -na, actual -
nqa, agentive -q, resultative -shqa, and infinitive -y. Conversely, to turn nouns into verbs, the 
following suffixes are frequently used: transformative -ya:, desiderative -na:, factive -tsa:, 
causative -tsi, middle -ku, and spontaneous -ka: (which is also described as a reflexive, medio-
passive or passive in other varieties).  
 
4.4.2.1 Nominal derivation (nominalization) 
 
4.4.2.1.1 -na ‘potential nominalizer (POT.NMLZ)’ 
-na nominalizes a verb from the perspective of its potential occurrence. Simply put, it expresses 
the possibility of an event. Frequently, it creates a referent that serves as an instrument, but also 
as an enabling location (e.g., tsapa-na ‘lid’ is the thing that allows the action denoted by the verb 
tsapa- ‘to cover’ to take place; but puklla-na denotes both the instrument ‘toy’ and the location 
‘playground’). -na, expressing an irrealis event, is central to purpose constructions (see Section 
4.8.4.2.3.4). It stands in direct contrast to -nqa, the actual or realis nominalizer, as Example (8) 
shows. 
 
(8)  Kanan  musyarirqunki imanaw rurana:kanqanta. 
{kanan musya-ri-rqu-nki   imanaw rura-na-ː     ka-nqa-n-ta} 
 now  know-PUNC-REC.PST-2.SBJ  how  make-POT.NMLZ-1.POSS be-ACT.NMLZ-ACC 
‘Now you know how my chores at home are.’   
 
Here rurana: (lit. ‘my potential doing,’ i.e. ‘my chores’) serves as the modifier to kanqanta 
‘what it actually is,’ the object of the cognition verb musya- ‘to know.’ 
 
4.4.2.1.2 -q ‘agentive nominalizer (AG)’ 
The nominalizer -q reifies an event based on the participant responsible for carrying out the 
event (the subject). For instance, in wamra salba-q ‘the savior of the child’ (from wamra ‘child’ 
and salba- ‘to save,’ a Spanish loan) the agentive nominalizer creates a referential noun. Notice 
that the modifier wamra corresponds to the object argument of salba-. Nominalizations with -q 
serve also as modifiers (e.g. qutsu-q yukis ‘singing thrush,’ from qutsu- ‘to sing’ and yukis 
‘thrush’). In this way, -q is used for relative clauses (see Section 4.8.4.2.1.1).  
It is common to refer to -q as an “agentive nominalizer.” However, this is not entirely 
accurate. The argument which -q creates does not need to be volitional nor affected by the result 
of an event carried out by another participant. Consider qishya-q (from qishya- ‘to be sick’) a 
state verb whose subject is the affected participant. Nothing implies that something caused the 
participant to be sick, let alone that the subject is agentive/volitional. 
 
4.4.2.1.3 -shqa ‘resultative nominalizer (RES)’ 
The nominalizer -shqa (commonly known also as  “past participle”) creates a referential 
expression understood in terms of a resulting state. For this reason it is widely used not only to 
create a referent, but also a deverbal adjective. For instance, wanu-shqa (from wanu- ‘to die’) 
can mean ‘dead one’ or simply denote the resulting quality, as in wanu-shqa allqu ‘dead dog.’ 
Moreover, -shqa commonly refers to whatever entity is affected, or results created during the 
event. Thus, muru-shqa-yki ‘what you sowed’ (from muru- ‘to sow,’ and with the 2nd person 
possessive suffix -yki) refers to a sowed entity. Constructions with -shqa can also be used as 
modifiers, which makes them analogous to relative clauses (see Section 4.8.4.2.1.1). 
 
4.4.2.1.4 -nqa ‘actual nominalizer (ACT.NMLZ)’ 
-nqa is used to express nominalized events corresponding to actual occurrences, either in the 
present or the past. In this sense, -nqa associates a “realis” modality to its referent. Parker (1976: 
102) described it as an “imperfective nominalizer.” This description is rather odd, since Parker 
states that the nominalized event could also have ended (perfective aspect). In fact, -nqa is not 
used consistently as either a perfective or imperfective marker. Instead, what this suffix conveys 
is an event nominalization understood as an actual occurrence, which is frequently used with 
verbs of knowledge, communication, and perception. For this reason, the referred event can be 
in-progress or complete, as seen in Example (9). 
 
(9)  Tushunqanta musya:. 
{tushu-nqa-n-ta  musya-:} 
 dance-ACT.NMLZ-3.SBJ-ACC  know-1.SBJ 
‘I know that s/he  is dancing / that s/he danced.’ 
 
-nqa is used less frequently in HQ because -shqa has taken over the function of expressing an 
actually occurring event (by focusing on the perfective profile of this suffix, see Section 
4.6.3.2.5). 
 
4.4.2.1.5 -y ‘infinitive (INF)’ 
The infinitive suffix -y, common to every Quechuan variety, is used as the basic verbal noun. In 
other words, it typifies an event without implying any temporal or modal information about it. 
Thus, qutsu-y is not only ‘to dance,’ but also ‘dancing’ and the equivalent to the noun ‘dance.’ 
Likewise, achacha-y (from achacha:- ‘to be hot’) can mean ‘heat.’ The rather neutral properties 
of the infinitive make it very commonly used as objects of verbs like muna- ‘to want,’ ‘to like,’ 
and yacha- ‘to know’ (see Section 4.8.4.2.2.1). 
 
4.4.2.2 Verbal derivation 
Suffixes in this class, -ya:, -na:, and -tsa:, all end in a long vowel. However, they will be found 
with a short vowel whenever followed by a coda consonant in the same syllable (e.g. yaku-na:-
nki ‘you feel thirsty’ becomes yakunanki [ja.kʊ.'nan.kɪ]). 
 
4.4.2.2.1 -ya: ‘transformative (TF)’ 
As a productive suffix, transformative -ya: takes a noun in order to derive a spontaneous 
resulting state.9 This basic function can be clearly seen in forms like puka-ya:- ‘to turn red; to 
blush’ (from puka- ‘red’) or waktsa-ya:- ‘to get poor’ (from waktsa- ‘poor; orphan’). However, -
ya: can be used in ways that are not transformative, but that imply a subject affected by the state 
resulting from an event having taken place. Thus, qanyas ‘the whole day’ and karu ‘far’ yield 
qanyas-ya:- ‘to spend the whole day,’ and karu-ya:- ‘to be far (from).’ Also, it is likely that this 
suffix is involved in turning onomatopoeic terms into verbs with imperfective lexical aspect (e.g. 
puqpuq-ya:- ‘to spurt out; to bubble with force’ and karkar-ya:- ‘to shiver’). 
 
4.4.2.2.2 -na: ‘desiderative (DESR)’ 
This suffix indicates that a subject is affected by the desire or propensity to experience an event. 
This last sense also includes that of an impending aspect (‘to be about to’). When it takes nouns 
as its basis, the resulting verbs suggest that the subject wants the referent of the noun (e.g. yaku-
na:- ‘to be thirsty,’ from yaku- ‘water,’ or warmi-na:- ‘to desire a woman,’ from warmi 
‘woman’). However, -na: is more frequently found with two types of verbs. First, it combines 
with intransitive ones expressing an affected subject or an event whose direct object is produced 
or emitted by the subject (e.g. ishki-na:- ‘to feel like falling; to be about to fall,’ from ishki- ‘to 
fall,’ waqa-na:- ‘to feel like crying; to be about to cry,’ from waqa- ‘to cry,’ ishpa-na:- ‘to feel 
like urinating; to about to urinate’). Second, it is used with atmospheric verbs. In those cases the 
event is impending or ‘about to happen’ (e.g. tamya-na:- ‘to be about to rain,’ from tamya ‘rain,’ 
ampi-na:- ‘to be about to get dark,’ from ampi- ‘to be dark’). 
 
4.4.2.2.3 -tsa: ‘factive (FACT)’ 
This suffix turns noun bases into verbs; the meaning of the base noun then denotes a resulting 
product, performance, or an extended state. These three uses can be respectively seen in wayi-
tsa:- ‘to make a house’ (from wayi ‘house’), haqa-tsa:- ‘to collect a debt’ (from haqa ‘debtor’), 
alli-tsa:- ‘to improve’ (from alli ‘good’), and puka-tsa:- ‘to make red’ (from puka ‘red’). Notice 
the contrast between -ya: and -tsa:: the first one is spontaneous, while the second one implies a 
causer that brings the results referred by the base noun.10  
 
4.4.2.2.4 -ta: ‘substance-covering (COV)’ 
This suffix has a very reduced distribution. It takes a nominal base referring to a substance (such 
as colors). The derived verb conveys the act of covering something with such substance (e.g. 
yawar-ta:- ‘to cover in blood,’ from yawar ‘blood,’ kachi-ta:- ‘to salt something, cover with 
salt,’ from kachi ‘salt,’ yuraq-ta:- ‘to paint white, to cover in white,’ from yuraq ‘white’). 
 
9 Sometimes -ya: is labeled “inchoative,” which should be reserved for an aspectual function. Since it only applies to 
nominal bases, and not to verbs, as aspect suffixes do, “transformative” is a more accurate descriptor. 
10 The combination of the transformative -ya: with causative -tsi is also frequently attested with a similar function to 
that of -tsa:. For instance yana ‘black’ yields yana-ya:-tsi- ‘to make turn black,’ whose meaning is analogous to that 
of yana-tsa:- ‘to make black.’ However, -ya:-tsi- does not imply a direct and sustained action from the subject in 
order to bring about a progressive change (e.d. an otherwise spontaneous transformation is triggered by the subject). 
On the other hand, -tsa: implies that the subject is making the object change through all the steps of the process.  
 
4.4.2.2.5 Voice as verbalizer: -tsi ‘causative (CAUS),’ -ku ‘reflexive, middle, medio-passive, 
passive (MID),’ and -ka: ‘passive-accidental (PASS.ACC)’ 
It is possible to find many instances of nouns that take suffixes that otherwise are used with 
verbs to mark voice alternations (see Section 4.6.2.2). The causative -tsi combines sometimes 
with nouns producing verbs similar to those using factitive -tsa:. Examples are huti-tsi- ‘to 
christen,’ from huti ‘name,’ ladu-tsi- ‘to put in one side,’ from ladu- ‘side,’ misa-tsi- ‘to have 
mass celebrated,’ from misa ‘Catholic mass,’ and chichi-tsi- ‘to breastfeed,’ from chichi 
‘breast’).  
The use of the reflexive voice suffix -ku as a verbalizer is a very productive mechanism 
in HQ. This construction indicates that the base noun is something procured, made, or worn by 
the subject. In this sense, the subject is always affected (as a beneficiary) by their own actions 
towards the noun referent. Examples are yuyu-ku- ‘to look for mustard leaves,’ wayna-ku- ‘to 
procure a lover for oneself,’ from wayna ‘lover, boyfriend,’ aswa-ku- ‘to prepare chicha,’ masa-
ku- ‘to make dough (for bread)’ (from Spanish masa), and tsuku-ku- ‘to put on a hat.’ 
In few cases, the spontaneous voice suffix -ka: is used with nouns to create a verb: 
qucha-ka:- ‘to become a lake’ (i.e. ‘to result a water accumulation’), kuta-ka:- ‘to end in a 
corner,’ tsillpi-ka:- ‘to become splinters; for an object to decay,’ and pirqa-ka:- ‘to end up 
formed a wall’ (from pirqa ‘wall,’ although it is used as an ambivalent stem). In those 
verbalizations the progressive passing of time until a result referring to the base noun takes place 
is implied. 
 
4.5 Nominals 
4.5.1 Subclasses of nominals 
HQ includes the typical classes of nouns found in other Quechuan languages. These include 
common nouns (e.g., tika ‘mud brick’), personal pronouns (nuqa ‘I,’ qam ‘you,’ pay ‘s/he, it’), 
demonstrative pronouns (e.g., kay ‘this,’ tsay ‘that’), quantifiers (llapa ‘all’), emphatic pronouns 
(kiki ‘self’), interrogative-indefinites (e.g., pi ‘who,’ ima ‘what,’ imay ‘when’), and numerals 
(e.g., huk ‘one,’ ishkay ‘two,’ kima ‘three’). 
Traditionally, a small class of pre-adjectives has been proposed. They include alla:pa ~ 
alla:pi ‘much,’ allibuwenu ‘very well’ (from Spanish bueno ‘good’), limpu ‘totally’ (perhaps 
from Spanish limpio ‘clean’), pasaypa ‘extremely’ (from Spanish pasar ‘to pass,’ ‘to surpass’), 
sayllama (['seʎama]) ‘very,’ shumaq ‘pretty; very,’ and mas ‘more’ (from Spanish). These terms 
profile the highest point of the scale implied by the term they modify. In other words, they stress 
a higher degree in, for instance, an adjective (e.g., alla:pa chukru ‘very hard’). Consequently, 
pre-adjectives are defined as adjective-modifying words. However, each and every one of the so-
called pre-adjectives in HQ can be used with verbs too without changes (e.g., pasaypa ranti-n 
‘he buys a lot,’ limpu ampikurin ‘it gets totally dark’).11 For this reason, it is best to view pre-
adjectives as a type of adverb: specifically, a modifier sensitive to scalar properties that are 
central to both the temporal profile of verbs and the degree of the quality implied in some 
specific nouns. 
 
4.5.1.1 Pronouns 
 
11 The only exception is mas, which modifies verbs as mas-ta, in the accusative case. 
HQ, like other Quechuan languages, includes personal pronouns (which can take case marking), 
demonstrative pronouns (also determiners), pronouns that only appear with nominal inflection 
(emphatic and quantifiers), and interrogative pronouns (which double as indefinite ones). 
 
4.5.1.1.1 Personal pronouns 
The main pronominal forms are nuqa ‘I,’ qam ‘you,’ and pay ‘s/he, it.’ As is common in most 
Quechuan languages, the 1st person plural distinguishes between nuqa-kuna, the exclusive form 
(i.e. the addressee is not included in the pronoun referent), and nuqa-ntsik, the inclusive form. 
The plural for the second and third person are qam-kuna and pay-kuna, respectively. Like every 
noun, personal pronouns are marked for case (nuqa-ntsik-paq ‘for us, including you’). If the 
subject has been made explicit and is maintained as topic, it is frequently left unmentioned, 
unless the speaker wants to emphasize the identity of the subject. It must be noted that personal 
pronouns are seldom used as direct objects (only if there is need to contrastively emphasize the 
referent of a direct object). Instead, as it is common in Quechuan languages, there is an object-
person marking system (see Section 4.6.3.1.2). 
 
4.5.1.1.2 Demonstrative pronouns 
These pronouns have a deictic function based on the location of the referent in relation to the 1st, 
2nd, and 3rd persons. While they can be used with the nominal plural suffix -kuna, this is 
infrequent. Thus, kay ‘this’ (e.g., kay wamra ‘this child’) points at a referent close to the speaker, 
but away from the speaker, and tsay ‘that’ (alternatively hay) indicates that the referent is close 
to the hearer, but away from the addressee (e.g., tsay / hay shipash ‘that young woman’). There 
are two evenly distributed 3rd person-based demonstratives. The first one, wak ‘that other,’ is 
based on the 3rd person considered as “the other” participant different from the speaker and the 
addressee (e.g., wak warmi ‘that other woman,’ wak bida-chaw ‘in the other life’ with bida 
‘life,’ from Spanish, and locative -chaw.) The second one, taqay ‘that over there’ does not imply 
the notion of “other,” and it seems more aligned with the deictic function kay ‘this’ and tsay 
‘that’ have since it points to a referent located away from both the speaker and the addressee 
(e.g., taqay marka ‘that town over there’). Other demonstratives are wakin ‘the other,’ and huk 
‘a, another.’ Wakin ‘the other’ is related to wak ‘that other’ and it is much more frequently used 
than the latter. It refers to entities whose definiteness is relative to a previously defined part of 
the set. Thus wakin is best understood as ‘some’ or ‘the rest.’ The numeral huk ‘one’ in HQ can 
be used to indicate a definite referent that has not yet been made specific in speech. 
Consequently, it could mean both ‘a’ and ‘another.’ Thus, huk ra:tu huk sitiyuchaw, huk ra:tu 
huk sitiyuchaw means ‘one time (ra:tu) at one place (sitiyu), another time at another place.’ 
 
4.5.1.1.3 Nominally inflected pronouns (emphatic and quantifiers) 
Some pronouns must be inflected for nominal agreement in addition to case marking. The first 
one is the emphatic pronoun kiki ‘self.’ In this way, kiki-: ‘myself’, kiki-yki ‘yourself’ 
(pronounced most usually [kɪkɪ-kɪ] or [kɪkɪː-kɪ] in careful speech), and kiki-n ‘him/her/itself’ 
indicate that their referent stands in sharp contrast to any other possible one (i.e. it is that person, 
and no other). In the 3rd person, this pronoun can be used as modifier (e.g., kiki-n tiyu-ntsik-paq 
‘for our uncle himself’). 
The second is the universal quantifier llapa ‘all’ (e.g. llapa-: ‘all of us,’ llapa-yki-kuna 
‘all of you’). As a modifier it is found only in the third person singular, llapa-n (e.g. llapa-n hara 
chakra ‘all of the corn plot’). Notice that plural marking is absent in the quantifier when the 
nominal head is marked (e.g. llapa-n pumakuna ‘all the cougars’). Thus, llapankuna only serves 
as a pronoun. Regarding the plural marking of llapa- ‘all,’ it seems that the presence of -kuna 
implies a precise reference to the individuals in a set. Thus, llapa-: alternates with llapa-:-kuna 
‘all of us,’ but examples of the latter are found connected with an enumeration of individuals.  
 
4.5.1.1.4 Interrogative and indefinite pronouns 
To form open questions HQ uses the following basic set of interrogative pronouns: ima ‘what,’ 
pi ‘who,’ imay ‘when,’ may ‘where,’ ayka ‘how much/many,’ and mayqin ‘which.’ Ima ‘what’ is 
used with other suffixes or in composition with other words in order to create imanaw ‘how’ 
(using the simulative case -naw), and imanir ‘why’ (lit. ‘saying what,’ using the same-subject 
subordinate ni-r ‘saying’). Imanir must be considered a lexicalized form, since it yields the form 
imanirpis ‘for whatever reason’ (see below). While these pronouns can be used as free forms, 
that is considered too direct and even rude. Therefore, it is more common to find them in 
combination with the following suffixes: direct evidential -m ~ -mi for more frontal questions, 
where a specific answer is considered necessary (e.g., Ima-m parla-nki? ‘What are you saying?,’ 
with parla- ‘to talk’); contrastive -taq/-tan is used more frequently to connect a question to the 
ongoing dialogue, as e.g. in Example (10). 
 
(10)  Aykatataq munanki?  
 {ayka-ta-taq    muna-nki?} 
 how.many-ACC-CONTR want-2.SBJ 
 ‘How many do you want?’ 
 
The continuative suffix -raq is present if the question implies an adverse situation or something 
that should not have happened, as in Example (11). 
 
(11) Imapaqraq takllata haqiramurqu:? 
 {ima-paq-raq   taklla-ta  haqi-ri-mu-rqu-u?}  
 what-BEN-CONT foot.plow-ACC leave-PUNC-CISL-REC.PST-1.SBJ 
 
Interrogative pronouns serve as the basis for indefinite ones. To do this, they take the additive 
suffix -pis (e.g., ima-pis ‘anything,’ ‘whatever,’ may-chaw-pis ‘in any place,’ ‘wherever’). 
Negative indefinite pronouns are tied to the use of mana ‘not’ in the sentence (e.g. mana ima-pis 
‘nothing’). However, the particle ni ‘nor’ (perhaps a Spanish loan) is frequently used to introduce 
a negative indefinite pronoun (e.g., ni ima-pis ‘nothing’, ni may-pis ‘nowhere’). Sometimes, ni is 
used without -pis in the pronoun (e.g. ni pi-pa haqa-n ka-a-tsu ‘I am not anybody’s debtor,’ with 
pi ‘who’ in genitive case -pa, and haqa ‘debtor’ marked with the 3rd person possessive suffix -n, 
and ka- ‘to be’ inflected for the 1st person by vowel lengthening with negative -tsu). The 
following table provides a summary of the interrogative and indefinite pronouns. 
 
<insert Table 4.6 here> 
 
4.5.1.2 Numerals 
HQ uses a decimal system. Once the number goes beyond a multiple of chunka ‘ten’ units start 
being added. To do this, this variety simply indicates the number of units right after the number 
of tenths. Thus, ‘eleven’ is chunka huk. A unit before chunka ‘ten,’ pachak ‘100,’ or waranqa 
‘1,000’ is a multiplier. Thus, ‘25’ is iskay chunka pitsqa (lit. ‘two ten five’), ‘749’ is qanchis 
pachak chusku chunka isqun, and ‘2036’ is iskay waranqa kima chunka huqta. Hunu 
‘1,000,000’ is mostly unknown in this variety. It is usual to find the agentive nominalizer -q 
combined with ishkay ‘two’ and kima ‘three.’ The forms ishkaq and kimaq mean ‘the two/three 
of them,’ and usually refer to people.  
Ordinal numbers are not used as a derived set from ordinal numbers. Instead, speakers 
use terms like punta ‘first’ (but also ‘before’) and yapay ‘second’ (but also ‘increase’). For 
further ordinals, Spanish terms are widely used (sigundu ‘second,’ tirsiru ‘third,’ etc.) 
The Spanish number system is widely used for keeping tally of produce and to carry on 
business. Native Quechua numbers are productive, but restricted to age, calendar (though years 
are frequently in Spanish), and to household activities. Table 4.7 presents the numeral system. 
 
<insert Table 4.7 here> 
 
4.5.1.3 Gender 
As it is common for Quechuan languages, nominals are not marked for gender. However, some 
roots include gender as part of their core meaning. Thus, shipash is ‘young woman’ and cho:lu is 
‘young man’ (from Peruvian Spanish cholo), while chakwas is ‘old woman’ and awkis is ‘old 
man.’ Also, it is frequent to introduce a gender distinction in terms of the biological sex of a 
person by using ullqu ‘male’ or warmi ‘woman.’ Thus, ullqu wawa and warmi wawa are ‘male 
baby’ and ‘female baby,’ respectively. For animals, ullqu is used, but for a female animal the 
term is china. Thus, ullqu allqu and china allqu are ‘male dog’ and ‘female dog.’ 
Many loans replicate the gender marking pattern of Spanish (e.g. lo:k-u ‘crazy-MASC’ and lo:k-a 
‘crazy-FEM,’ duktur ‘doctor-MASC’ and duktur-a ‘doctor-FEM’). 
 
4.5.1.4 Order of constituents in the nominal phrase 
Even if there is relative freedom of constituents in the clause, the nominal phrase order is quite 
rigid (Example 12 is adapted from Parker 1976: 31): 
 
(12)  tsay llapan kima mana allapa allim uchuk hara chakra (-kuna) 
 DEM all three not very good little corn field (-PL) 
 i ii iii iv v vi vii viii head  ix 
‘all three of those not very good little corn fields’ 
 
The position slots are thus: (i) demonstrative, (ii) quantifier, (iii) number, (iv) negator, (v) scalar 
adverb (i.e. pre-adjective), (vi) adjective (i.e. quality noun), (vii) adjective (i.e. size noun), (viii) 
attributive noun, and (ix) plural. 
 
4.5.2 Nominal derivation 
This morphological process derives a noun from a base noun. There are five suffixes used for 
this process, (i) -yuq ‘inalienable possession (INAL.POSS)’ and -sapa ‘multiple possession 
(MULT.ALL)’ use the base to indicate what is possessed. -ntin ‘accompaniment, adjacency (INCL)’ 
presents a relation of inclusivity. The suffix -lla ‘restrictive, limitative (LIM),’ 
which can also be found with verbs, restricts the reference of its base by making it unique. 
Finally, -mayi ‘partnership (PART)’ suggests that the base noun is a shared characteristic between 
members of a group. 
 
4.5.2.1 -yuq ‘inalienable possession (INAL.POSS)’ 
As it is common in most Quechuan languages, there is no verbal root meaning ‘to have.’ One of 
the ways in which possession is expressed requires the use of the suffix -yuq with a noun base. 
Thus, wayi ‘house’ yields wayi-yuq ‘house owner, one who has a house.’ The possessive relation 
is expressed with the copula, as in Example (13). 
 
(13)  Qam shumaq wasiyuq kanki. 
 {qam shumaq  wasi-yuq   ka-nki} 
 you pretty house-INAL.POSS  be-2.SBJ 
‘You have a pretty house.’ (lit. ‘You are a pretty-house-owner.’) 
 
This suffix can be added to any type of nominal, including nominalizations, with the exception 
perhaps of personal pronouns (e.g. tsay-ni-yuq ‘that has that,’ ima-yuq ‘that has something,’ 
kawa-y-yuq ‘that has life,’ from kawa- ‘to live’ marked with the infinitive suffix-y.) 
What defines -yuq is that it indicates that the nominal it marks is an inalienable 
possession of the nominal it modifies. In this way, the possessed entity is viewed as not freely 
transferrable, and it helps characterize its owner. Consequently, body parts (e.g., piqa-yuq ka-: ‘I 
have a head,’ from piqa ‘head’), family members (e.g., warmi-yuq ka-nki ‘you have a wife,’ 
from warmi ‘woman’), and inherent qualities (e.g., chani-yuq ‘that has value, costly,’ from chani 
‘value,’ and huti-yuq ‘that has a name, named,’ from huti ‘name’) use this suffix. Example (14) 
shows that the nominal head nuna ‘person’ is characterized by having the name ‘Abraham.’ 
  
(14)  Abraham hutiyuq nuna shamun. 
 {abraham  huti-yuq   nuna  shamu-n} 
 abraham  name-INAL.POSS  person come-3.SBJ 
 ‘A person named Abraham has come.’ (lit. ‘an Abraham-name-having person’) 
 
4.5.2.2 -sapa ‘multiple possession (MULT.ALL)’ 
This suffix also conveys a possessive notion. Thus, wayi-sapa indicates that someone possesses 
many houses. The difference between this suffix and -yuq is based on the quantity of the 
possessed entity: -sapa indicates a greater amount of it. This increased possession does not 
distinguish between individual entities (e.g., wa:ka-sapa nuna ‘person owner of many cows,’ 
from wa:ka ‘cow’) or substances (qillay-sapa nuna ‘rich person,’ from qillay ‘silver, money’). 
 
4.5.2.3 -ntin ‘accompaniment, adjacency (INCL)’ 
This suffix indicates that its base referent is included together with another entity (e.g., utsu-ntin 
‘with hot pepper,’ from utsu ‘hot pepper,’ yawar-ni-ntin ‘with blood,’ from yawar ‘blood,’ 
which requires the epenthetic suffix -ni). Example (15) shows a context of use. 
 
(15)  Kashkitapis rurantsik aytsallantin. 
 {kashki-ta-pis   rura-ntsik  aytsa-lla-ntin} 
 soup-ACC-ADD   make-1PL.SBJ  meat-LIM-INCL 
 ‘We also make soup with meat.’ 
 
-ntin also indicates that all the parts of the base referent are equally involved. This can be seen 
with the quantifier llapa ‘all’ (llapa-ntin ‘all together,’ ‘including everyone’), the particle hina 
‘like, so’ (hina-ntin ‘everywhere’), and nouns like ampi ‘night’ (ampi-ntin ‘all night’). 
 
4.5.2.4 -mayi ‘partnership (PART)’ 
A noun marked with -mayi indicates that its referent shares with another individual a partnership 
defined by the base. Examples are marka-mayi ‘fellow town person,’ from marka ‘town,’ yawar-
mayi ‘relative’ (lit. ‘blood mate’), llamkay-mayi ‘co-worker,’ from llamka-y ‘work-INF,’ wiñay-
mayi ‘contemporary; age peer,’ from wiña-y ‘grow-INF.’  
 
4.5.2.5 -lla ‘restrictive, limitative (LIM)’ 
This suffix restricts the referent of the noun to either a single entity or a single class (e.g. tanta-
lla ‘only bread,’ from tanta ‘bread,’ qam-lla ‘just you,’ from qam ‘you.’ The delimitative sense 
takes place right before case marking. When this suffix takes the position immediately after the 
nominal stem, it takes a diminutive meaning (e.g. yanaqi-lla-n-kuna-lla-wan ‘just with your little 
friends,’ from yanaqi ‘friend’ with 3rd person -n, plural -kuna, and instrumental case -wan.)12 
 
4.5.3 Nominal inflection 
As is customary for Quechuan languages, nouns are inflected for person, number, and case. The 
nominal suffixes are distributed in the following order: derivational, person, number, and case. 
The complete distribution of derivational and inflectional suffixes is illustrated in Table 8.  
 
<insert table 4.8 here> 
 
4.5.3.1 Person 
Quechuan languages make extensive use of nominal person marking. Its most obvious function 
is that of indicating the possessor of an entity. For this reason, they are frequently labeled 
“possessive suffixes.” Table 9 presents the nominal agreement paradigm. 
 
<Insert table 4.9 here> 
 
The use of the plural marker -kuna produces ambiguity when combined with person. Thus, wayi-
i-kuna (from wayi ‘house’) means not only ‘our (EXCL) house,’ but also ‘our (EXCL) houses’ 
with a plural possessed referent, as well as ‘my houses’ (where -kuna has scope only over the 
possessed referent, not the person/possessor.) 
Person marking can be used with any nominal base, with the exception perhaps of 
personal pronouns (e.g. kay-ni-: ‘this thing of mine,’ tsay-ni-n ‘that thing of his/hers,’ ima-yki 
‘what thing of yours,’ ishka-: ‘the two of us’). The quantifier llapa ‘all’ and the emphatic 
pronoun kiki ‘self’ must always be marked for person in HQ (see Section 4.5.1.1.3). 
HQ, like most Quechuan languages, uses nominal person in several syntactic 
constructions. This is seen in the agreement between a genitive-marked person and the noun they 
are linked to (see Section 4.5.3.3.1), and in nominalized verbs using person marking to indicate 
grammatical relations (see Section 4.8.4.2.2.2) 
 
 
12 The status of -lla as a derivational suffix is not entirely clear. An almost identical form -lla: can be considered a 
verbal derivational suffix (see Section 6.2.3.2.) Perhaps -lla should be analyzed as an enclitic. 
4.5.3.2 Number  
The plural is marked through -kuna (e.g. shipash-kuna ‘young women,’ from shipash ‘young 
woman’). When another word indicating plurality is present, HQ speakers alternate between the 
use of -kuna and its absence. Thus, atska nuna-kuna and atska nuna are acceptable for ‘many 
people.’ Likewise, ‘four sheep’ can be chusku u:sha or chusku u:shakuna. Combining -kuna with 
person marking in a noun produces ambiguity with regards to what is pluralized, either the 
person, the base noun, or both (see Section 4.5.3.1). 
 
4.5.3.3 Case  
As in any Quechuan language, this variety has a rich case system. Every noun is overtly marked 
to provide information about its role in the phrase or sentence (subject, object, goal, possessor, 
among others). In some cases, case marker can be stacked (usually genitive -pa, instrumental -
wan, similitude -naw). The nominative is zero-marked, as it is the case for the subject in 
nominative-accusative languages (see Section 4.8.1). There are twelve case markers in HQ, and I 
will describe all of them seprarately, except the nominative. Nominative case is unmarked, as in 
every Quechuan language, and it expresses the subject argument of transitive and intransitive 
verbs (see Section 4.8.1.) Table 4.10 introduces and exemplifies them  
 
 
<Insert table 4.10 here>  
 
4.5.3.3.1 -ta ‘accusative (ACC)’ 
This is the case of the object argument of a transitive verb, as in Example (16). 
 
(16)  Tantata rura:. 
{tanta-ta  rura-:} 
bread-ACC make-1.SBJ 
‘I make bread.’ 
 
It is common to use -ta to indicate the ultimate goal of a motion event (Example 17). In this 
sense, it contrasts with -man, which profiles the path that leads into the goal (see Section 
4.5.3.3.3): 
 
(17)  Wayiyikita purishun. 
{wayi-yiki-ta   puri-shun} 
 house-2.POSS-ACC walk-1PL.INCL.SBJ.FUT 
 ‘Let’s walk to your house’ 
 
HQ does not distinguish between direct and indirect object. The latter is the theme argument or 
the one affected in a way that is subordinate to another participant’s affectedness. Consequently, 
ditransitive verbs like qu- ‘to give,’ qara- ‘to serve,’ or qatu- ‘to sell’ yield double accusative 
constructions. Usually, in these constructions the argument closer to the verb is the theme, 
although sometimes it is located after the verb (even without -ta, making it a zero-marked 
object). (18) furnishes examples with qu- ‘to give.’ 
 
(18)  a. Shanti tsurinta ruripata qurqan. 
  {shanti  tsuri-n-ta  ruripa-ta qu-rqa-n}
  Santiago child-3.POSS-ACC skirt-ACC give-PST-3.SBJ 
  ‘Santiago gave his child a skirt.’ 
 
b. Payta qun puka hilu. 
{pay-ta  qu-n   puka  hilu-Ø} 
s/he-ACC give-3.SBJ red thread-ACC 
‘She gives him a red thread.’ 
  
While -ta is generally associated with the affected participant in an event, this suffix is found 
with nouns that are the source of the subject’s experience. With this function, -ta is tied to verbs 
with low transitivity like perception and emotion. As illustrated in Example (19), -ta crucially is 
also found with intransitive verbs without any valency-increasing voice suffix (Parker 1973a:16): 
 
(19)  a. Na:nita rikaykaya:. 
{na:ni-ta rika:-yka:-ya-ː} 
road-ACC see-IPFV-PL-1.SBJ 
‘We are seeing the road.’ 
 
b. Warma mamanta waqan.  
{warma  mama-n-ta   waqa-n} 
child  mother-3.POSS-ACC cry-3.SBJ 
‘The child is crying for her mom.’ (i.e. ‘due to her mom’) 
 
HQ speakers sometimes leave the direct object unmarked. As already seen in Example (18b) 
above, ditransitive verbs can leave its theme object unmarked. Also, a stereotypical object, or 
just an inanimate one, can be left unmarked (e.g. papa alla- ‘to dig out potatoes’ from alla- ‘to 
dig.’) 
Finally, -ta is used to turn quality nouns (i.e. ‘adjectives’) into verb modifiers (i.e. 
‘adverbs.’) This can be seen in alli-ta mikuy ‘eat well’ (from alli ‘good’ with mikuy ‘eat,’ a 
command) and atska-ta upyay ‘drink a lot,’ ‘drink much’ (from atska ‘many’ and upyay ‘to 
drink,’ a command). 
 
4.5.3.3.2 -pa ‘genitive (GEN)’ 
As in many Quechuan languages, the genitive -pa is used in agreement with the nominal person 
marking to indicate the possessor of the referred entity, as seen in Example (20). 
 
(20)  Peyupa warmin 
{peyu-pa  warmi-n} 
pedro-GEN woman-3.POSS 
‘Pedro’s wife’ 
 
As shown in Example (21), this agreement process can be recursive. 
 
(21)  Peyupa warminpa turin 
{peyu-pa  warmi-n-pa  turi-n} 
pedro-GEN woman-3.POSS-GEN brother.of.a.woman-3.POSS 
‘Pedro’s wife’s brother’ 
 
This suffix also indicates a path for motion events, specifically ‘through’, or ‘along’ as in 
Example (22). 
 
(22)  Hirkakunapa hananpa aywan. 
 {hirka-kuna-pa hana-n-pa  aywa-n} 
 mountain-PL-GEN top-3.POSS-GEN go-3.SBJ 
 ‘It goes through the top of the mountains.’ 
 
This function of -pa might be active in expressions like ampi-pa (‘at night,’ from ampi ‘night’) 
or hunaq-pa (‘during daytime,’ from hunaq ‘day’). Perhaps it is also related to the use of -pa to 
create modifiers indicating the condition in which the subject is when doing or experiencing an 
event. It can also be used to modify how the event takes place. In this function, -pa is frequently 
found alongside the delimitative -lla. Examples are chaki-pa ‘by foot, on foot’ (from chaki 
‘feet’), fiyu-pa ‘badly; strongly’ (from fiyu ‘ugly,’ a Spanish loan), waqa-lla-pa ‘crying’ (from 
waqa ‘cry’), paka-y-lla-pa ‘hiddenly, sneakily (from paka- ‘to hide’ in the infinitive). The next 
example illustrates the use of genitive -pa with a nominalized verb with infinitive -y.  
 
(23)  Huanshi mantsapaypa puriykan. 
{huanshi  mantsa-pa:-y-pa puri-yka:-n} 
Juan   fear-APPL-INF-GEN  walk-IPFV-3.SBJ 
‘Juan is walking afraid (of something).’ 
 
4.5.3.3.3 -man ‘allative (ALL)’ 
With this case speakers mark the direction and endpoint into/onto which something moves (e.g. 
marka-man ‘to town,’ from marka ‘town,’ or uray-man ‘downwards,’ from uray ‘down’). A 
further example is in (24). 
 
(24)  U:sa:kuna quchaman hiqaykurqun. 
{u:sha-ː-kuna  qucha-man hiqa-yku-rqu-n}
sheep-1.POSS-PL lake-ALL fall-IW-REC.PST-3.SBJ 
‘Our sheep have fallen into the lake.’ 
 
-man is never used to mark an indirect object in HQ (see Section 4.5.3.3.1). 
 
4.5.3.3.4 -chaw ‘locative (LOC)’ 
This case makes its base noun a location. It is commonly translated as ‘in,’ ‘on,’ or ‘at.’ For 
instance, chakra-chaw ‘in the crop field’ (from chakra ‘crop field, plot’), hunaq-chaw (‘in the 
day,’ ‘during the day.’) 
 
4.5.3.3.5  -paq ‘dative, allative, purposive (DAT)’ 
With animate referents, this case marks the beneficiary or maleficiary of an event, as in Example 
(23). 
 
(25)  Kallmi paninpaq takiykan.  
 {kallmi  pani-n-paq     taki-yka:-n} 
 carmen  sister.of.a.woman-3.POSS-BEN  sing-IPFV-3.SBJ 
 ‘Carmen sings for her sister.’ 
 
In general, -paq conveys that a noun is the goal towards which an action aims. In this allative 
sense, there is no implicit path, only the -paq-marked endpoint of the action. This is illustrated in 
the Examples in (26). 
 
(26) a. Limapaq purikuya:shaq. 
  {lima-paq  puri-ku-ya:-shaq 
lima-ALL  walk-MID-PLV-1.SBJ.FUT 
‘We will go to Lima.’ (i.e. ‘We go to Lima’) 
 
b. Huk killana fiyistapaq faltan. 
{huk  killa-na  fistiya-paq  falta-n} 
one  month-DISC  party-ALL  be.left-3.SBJ 
‘There is already one month left for the party.’ 
 
-paq is also used to indicate the purpose of non-motion events (see Section 4.8.4.2.3.2). While an 
animate endpoint tends to be interpreted as a beneficiary, affectedness of a dative participant is 
not guaranteed. To indicate full beneficiary status in an animate participant, the voice suffix -pu 
is used. For this reason, it is best to see -paq as a dative, and not as a benefactive (see Section 
8.6.2.2.5).  
 
4.5.3.3.6 -piq ~ -pita ‘ablative (ABL)’ 
Either -piq or -pita mark a noun as the starting point of a motion, or the source of an event or 
state (e.g. Huaras-piq ‘from Huaraz,’ from the toponym Huaraz, waray-pita ‘since the morning,’ 
from waray ‘morning,’ or quri-pita ‘of gold,’ from quri ‘gold’) There is widespread alternation 
between -piq and -pita, which are indistinguishable in meaning. -pita is preferred in the Southern 
Huaylas variety, while -piq is preferred in the Northern one. Both forms originate from *-piqta, 
which is still used by few elderly speakers in the Northern Huaylas variety (Julca Guerrero 2010: 
165–74.) The ablative also indicates the reason for something, most frequently with nominalized 
clauses (e.g. tsay-pita ‘due to that; then or the Example in 27). 
 
(27) aywakunqanpita  
{aywa-ku-nqa-n-pita} 
go-MID-ACT.NMLZ-3.POSS-ABL 
 ‘due to his leaving’ 
 
In this sense, -pita ~ -piq is replacing -raykur as a causal case (see Section 4.5.3.3.10). 
 
4.5.3.3.7 -naw ‘simulative (SIMUL)’ 
The simulative case indicates that its base noun serves as the reference point in a comparison 
(e.g. atuq-naw ‘like a fox,’ from atuq ‘fox,’ chukis-naw ‘like someone from Conchucos,’ from 
chukis ‘person from Conchucos,’ or kay-naw ‘like this,’ from kay ‘this’). 
 
4.5.3.3.8 -yaq, -kama ‘limitative (LIM)’ 
This case alternates in HQ between -yaq and -kama. They indicate that some path or time period 
is covered until the limit determined by the base noun. It is commonly translated as until, e.g.  
hirka-yaq or hirka-kama ‘until the mountain,’ from hirka mountain,’ and waray-yaq or waray-
kama ‘until dawn,’ from waray ‘dawn.’ While both forms are used in Northern and Southern 
varieties, -kama is more frequent in the Southern one. It is possible to use the ablative case 
meaning ‘while’ or ‘during.’ This seems to be possible only with the actual nominalizer -nqa, as 
illustrated in Example (28). 
 
(28)  Waska:ta apamunqa:yaq runkulla:ta umpakurillaqman. 
{waska-ː-ta   apa-mu-nqa-ː-yaq  
rope-1.POSS-ACC bring-CISL-ACT.NMLZ-1.POSS-LIM   
 
runkulla-ː-ta   umpa-ku-ri-lla-q-man} 
bag-1.POSS-ACC entrust-MID-PUNC-LIM-1SBJ.2.OBJ-COND 
‘While I bring my rope, could I entrust you with my bag?’ (Lit. ‘I would entrust you 
with’) 
 
As shown in Example (29), the combination -kama-yaq is possible in the same noun to 
emphasizes a full duration of an event or a full covered path of a motion event. 
 
(29)  Tsayshi kanankamayaq waqayan suwirtillankunata. 
{tsay-shi  kanan-kama-yaq  waqa-ya:-n  suwirti-lla-n-kuna-ta} 
DEM-EVR now-LIM-LIM  cry-PLV-3SBJ luck-LIM-3.POSS-PL-ACC 
‘Therefore, up until now they cry for their luck.’ 
 
4.5.5.3.3.9 -wan ‘comitative-instrumental (COM)’ 
This case suffix has two main functions. First, it marks a noun as an instrument, that is, a co-
causer subordinate to the subject participant, as in Example (30). 
 
(30)  Llawiwan punku-ta kicharqa:. 
 {llawi-wan punku-ta kicha-rqa-ː} 
 key-COM door-ACC open-PST-1.SBJ 
 ‘I opened the door with the key.’ 
 
The second function, comitative, is to indicate that a noun referent is co-present alongside some 
other entity. This interpretation is preferred with animate beings: 
 
(31)  Malli taytanwan qatswan. 
{malli  tayta-n-wan   qatswa-n} 
maría father-3.POSS-COM dance-3SBJ 
‘María dances with her father 
 
Also, comitative -wan is used for coordinating more than one nominal. Usually, it marks the first 
member of the set (e.g. ashnu-wan atuqkuna ‘the donkey and the foxes’). However, it is also 
possible to use it to mark all the members. In Example (32) i ‘and’ (from Spanish y) is used also 
as a coordinator.  
 
(32)  Yacha: Limachawmi papa:ni:wan, mama:ni:wan, wawqi:kunawan i pani:wan. 
 {yacha-ː  lima-chaw-mi   papa:-ni-ː-wan mama:-ni-ː-wan 
 reside-1.SBJ Lima-LOC-EVD  dad-EP-1.SBJ-COM mom-EP-1.SBJ-COM 
wawqi-ː-kuna-wan    i  pani-ː-wan} 
brother.of.a.man-1.POSS-PL-COM and sister.of.a.man-1.POSS-COM 
‘I live in Lima with my dad, my mom, my brothers, and sisters.’ 
 
4.5.3.3.10 -raykur ‘causal (CSL)’ 
This case makes its base noun a cause, reason, or motivation (e.g. qillay-raykur ‘for money,’ 
from qillay ‘silver, money,’ yanasa-raykur ‘due to a friend,’ from yanasa ‘female friend,’ or 
tsay-raykur ‘because of that,’ a frequent consequence connective from tsay ‘that’). The next 
example shows how the noun tsuri-yki ‘your child’ serves as the cause for the verb urya- ‘to 
work.’ 
 
(33)  Tsuriykiraykur uryaykanki. 
{tsuri-yki-raykur  urya-yka:-nki} 
child-2.POSS-CSL work-IPFV-2.SBJ 
‘You are working for your child.’ 
 
4.5.3.3.11 -pura ‘exclusive (EXCL)’ 
The exclusive -pura establishes that only the elements within the set determined by the base 
noun participate in some event. This suffix emphasizes the members of the noun-class in 
exclusion of any entity outside that class.13 For instance, forms like yanaqi-pura ‘among friends’ 
(from yanaqi ‘male friend’), kiki-n-pura ‘among themselves’ (from kiki ‘self’ with the 3rd 
person possessive suffix), and marka-pura ‘within towns’ (from marka ‘town’) specify who or 
what is exclusively involved in an event. Due to this involvement, -pura is labeled “interactive” 
by Julca Guerrero (2009a: 191). With numerals (including fractions), -pura indicates the number 
of participants among which the amount gets distributed (e.g. pullan pura ‘half and a half,’ 
‘between two,’ from pullan ‘half,’ pitsqa chunka pura ‘fifty per person,’ from pitsqa chunka 
‘fifty’). Parker (1976: 89) calls this use “adverbial” because it specifies how the distribution is 
done (i.e. the noun with pura modifies the verb). Arguably, -pura refers instead to the subject of 
the sentence to elaborate upon the number of participants exclusively involved. The distributive 
use of -pura and its relation to non-quantifying expressions still needs analysis. 
 
4.6 Verbs 
HQ’s verbs are bound stems which at least are inflected for person and tense. However, most 
frequently they are marked with aspect and voice derivational suffixes. As is usual in Quechuan 
languages, verbal stems are not a numerous class. My verbal database counts around a thousand 
of them. However, verbal derivational morphology allows for many meaning specifications that 
enhance a verb’s expressive potential. For example, apa- ‘to take’ yields apa-mu- ‘to bring’ (i.e. 
‘to take towards the speaker,’ with -mu ‘cislocative’), and apa-tsi- ‘to send’ (i.e. ‘to make take,’ 
 
13 Some authors like Parker (1976: 89) consider -pura a particle. However, there is no clear indication that this form 
can be used independently of a nominal base immediately preceding it. Therefore, we classify it as a case suffix.  
with -tsi ‘causative’), not to mention lexicalized derivational suffixes leading to forms like apari- 
‘to carry on the back’ (likely from *-ri ‘upwards, above.’)  
 
4.6.1 Verb subclasses 
Based on how they relate to other nominal arguments, three verb subclasses have been proposed 
for HQ and perhaps every other Quechuan language: (i) copulatives relate nouns with predicates 
(e.g. ka- ‘to be,’ tuku- ‘to become’), (ii) intransitives, which denote events that require a single 
participant to take place or being experienced (e.g. aywa- ‘to go,’ wanu- ‘to die’), and (iii) 
transitive verbs that require the interaction of two participants (e.g. rura- ‘to make,’ chura- ‘to 
put’). 
 
4.6.1.1 Copulative verbs 
Copulas are verbs that relate their subject to a nominal predicate. The most basic and frequent 
copula is ka- ‘to be, exist.’ 
 
(34)  Nuqa chakra nunam ka:.  
{nuqa  chakra   nuna-m  ka-ː} 
I crop.field person-EVD be-1.SBJ 
‘I am a peasant.’ (i.e. ‘a farm person’)  
 
As with most Quechuan languages, a 3rd person singular subject (pay ‘s/he, it’) does not take 
overt ka- in the present tense. Therefore, ‘he is my fellow townsman’ (with llaqtamasi ‘fellow 
townsman’) cannot use the 3rd person form ka-n. Instead, it must be rendered as in Example 
(35). 
 
(35) Pay llaqtamasi:mi. 
 {pay  llaqtamasi-:-mi} 
s/he fellow.townsman-1.SBJ-EVD 
‘He is my fellow townsman.’ 
 
However, whenever non-overt ka-n takes any other aspect, tense, or mood suffix, it gets overtly 
expressed, as in Example (36). 
 
(36) Pay llaqtamasi:mi karqan.  
 {Pay  llaqtamasi:-mi    ka-rqa-n} 
 s/he fellow.townsman-1.POSS-EVD  be-PST-3.SBJ 
‘He was my fellow townsman.’ 
 
It is common to find ka- marked in the continuous aspect -yka:. With this aspect, the copula is 
understood as an ongoing state that can be framed within an unbounded time period (see Section 
4.6.2.1.1.1). Thus, ka-yka- conveys a predicate as a background. Example (37) illustrates this 
use. 
 
(37)  Wak bidachawmi almayki mula kaykan. 
 {wak   bida-chaw-mi  alma-yki  mula  ka-yka:-n} 
 that.other life-LOC-EVD soul-2.POSS mule be-IPFV-3.SBJ 
 ‘In the other life your soul is a mule.’ 
 
As shown in Example (38), when ka-n is overtly used, it only expresses the subject’s existence  
 
(38) Allqu kan.  
 {allqu  ka-n} 
 dog be-3.SBJ 
 ‘There is a dog.’ 
 
As shown in Example (39), in this function ka- remains uninflected for number. 
 
(39)  Atska fiyistakuna kan. 
 {atska  fiyista-kuna  ka-n} 
 many party-PL be-3.SG 
 ‘There are many parties.’ 
 
The existential function of ka- ‘to be’ is crucial for the expression of possession in HQ. As 
characteristic in most Quechuan languages, there is no verb meaning ‘to have.’ Instead, to say “X 
has something” speakers literally say: “X’s something exists.” The genitive-marked possessor is 
optional in this construction, as in Example (40). 
 
(40)  (Nuqapa) llanqi: kan. 
{(Nuqa-pa) llanqi-ː  ka-n  
I-GEN   sandals-1.POSS be-3.SBJ  
‘I have sandals.’ (Lit. ‘There are my sandals of mine.’)  
 
It is possible to convey a stronger bond between the possessor and the possessed entity in HQ by 
using the benefactive suffix -pu with ka- ‘to be.’ Examples (41) and (42) illustrate this. 
 
(41)  Luis Pardopa kapunaq huk kumpa:rim. 
 {Luis  Pardo-pa  ka-pu-naq   huk  kumpari-m} 
 Luis  Pardo-GEN be-BEN-NARR.PST one compadre-EVD 
 ‘Luis Pardo had one compadre.’ (Lit. ‘A compadre of Luis Pardoi belonged to himi’) 
 
(42)  Nuqapapis atskam kapaman. 
{nuqa-pa-pis  atska-m ka-pu-ma:-n 
I-GEN-ADD many-EVD be-BEN-1.OBJ-3.SBJ 
‘I also have a lot (of them)’ (‘A lot (of them) belong to me too’) 
 
Notice that the subject of ka-n is the possessed entity. However, no nominal agreement exists 
between the genitive possessor and the possessed entity (as in Luis Pardo-pa kumpari-n ‘Luis 
Pardo’s compadre’). It seems that in this construction the possessor is an appositional nominal 
construction sharing the same referent as the possessed entity. As such, it is optional (both huk 
kumpa:ri kapun and atska kapaman are acceptable). Finally, this construction is closer in 
meaning to English ‘to belong’ since the possessor’s referent is given by an object introduced by 
benefactive suffix -pu. In Example (41) it is a 1st person marked with -ma:, while in (42) it is a 
zero-marked 3rd person. 
  Besides ka- ‘to be,’ the only other copulative verb is tuku- ‘to pretend to be,’ as e.g. in the 
Example in (43). 
 
(43) Qillaysapa tukunki.  
 {Qillaysapa   tuku-nki} 
 money-MULT.ALL pretend.to.be-2.SBJ 
 ‘You pretend to be rich.’ 
 
In some sources (e.g. Pantoja et al. 1974), tuku- is used as a suffix attached to nouns and 
nominalized forms, as in Example (44). 
 
(44)  wanuqtukur 
 {wanu-q-tuku-r} 
 die-AG-pretend.to.be-SUBIS 
  ‘pretending to be dead’  
 
4.6.1.2 Transitive verbs 
Transitive verbs require two arguments for its elaboration. As a nominative-accusative language 
(see Section 4.8.1), HQ’s transitive verbs have a subject in the nominative case, and an object in 
the accusative case (marked with -ta). Verbs expressing dynamic actions involving two 
participants, an agent, and a patient, are the most representative of this class (e.g. taka- ‘to hit, 
knock,’ rura- ‘to make,’ or suwa- ‘to steal.’) 
Verbs that indicate a caused motion are prime cases of transitivity: the change of state 
they convey by placing the object in a different location or by causing a change in their posture is 
seen as mainly affecting the object participant. This is the reason why -ku, the middle-reflexive 
suffix that stresses the affectedness of the subject, and otherwise capable of combining with 
virtually every type of verb, seldom combines with caused motion events. Thus, caused motion 
verbs are at the very end of a semantic transitivity cline, fully distinguishable from intransitive 
ones. 
Understanding verbal transitivity as the presence of two participants distorts the 
conceptual flexibility of HQ verbs. For instance, verbs of consumption like miku- ‘to eat’ or 
upya- ‘to drink’ are listed as transitive because they take a direct object marked with -ta. Still, 
the main affected participant is the subject, who experiences the effects of consuming an object 
that becomes something of an inalienable possession. Thus, verbs of consumption are closer to 
intransitivity: quite frequently they appear without a direct object, not even one previously 
mentioned. Moreover, the use of the middle suffix -ku is customary for them, because the 
subject’s affectedness is more prominent than the object’s. Similarly, several cognition verbs 
(including perception and emotion) are viewed as transitive because they take a -ta-marked 
object. The examples in (45) ‒ (47) illustrate this. 
 
(45)  U:sha atuqta mantsan. 
 {u:sha atuq-ta   mantsa-n} 
 sheep  atuq-ACC fear-3.SBJ 
 ‘The sheep fears the fox.’ 
 
(46) Michi aytsata ma:kurinaq. 
 {michi aytsa-ta  ma:ku-ri-naq} 
 cat meat-ACC notice-PUNC-NARR.PST 
 ‘The cat noticed the meat.’ 
 
(47)  Peyu mankata rikaykan. 
 {peyu  manka-ta  rika:-yka:-n} 
 pedro pot-ACC see-IPFV-3.SBJ 
 ‘Pedro is looking at the pot.’ 
 
The use of a direct object in HQ is not restricted to typically transitive dynamic actions. Instead, 
objects are complements that elaborate an event as the interaction of two participants. However, 
for some verbs like those of emotion, cognition, and perception, those objects are not affected 
ones, but stimuli for their experiencing subject. As stimuli, they must be considered as a cause 
for the event. Consequently, transitivity goes beyond a simple agent-patient relation to include an 
experiencer-stimulus one. This is the reason behind Parker’s (1973a: 16) pioneering observation 
regarding the possibility of using -ta-marked direct objects with intransitive verbs like asi- ‘to 
laugh,’ waqa- ‘to cry,’ llaki- ‘to be sad,’ aha- ‘to be mad,’ or puklla- ‘to play’ (which becomes 
‘to taunt’ or ‘to flirt with’ with a direct object). Furthermore, -ta can be deployed in order to 
create this type of constructions with verbs that are otherwise basically intransitive (see Section 
4.5.3.3.1 above, but also Section 8.6.2.2.6 for applicative voice.)  
For ditransitive constructions involving double accusative marking, see Section 4.5.3.3.1. 
 
4.6.1.3 Intransitive verbs 
An intransitive verb denotes an event that can be carried out sufficiently by a single participant. 
Usually, motion events are considered prototypical instances of intransitive verbs. Translational 
motion events like aywa- ‘to go,’ pa:ri- ‘to fly,’ hiqa- ‘to fall,’ and non-translational ones like 
ta:- ‘to sit,’ sha:ri- ‘to get up,’ and tuma- ‘to turn’ all have a single subject participant acting on 
its own. Other dynamic events commonly considered as intransitive are atmospheric ones (e.g. 
tamya- ‘to rain,’ wayra- ‘to be windy,’ and ampi- ‘to become night’).  
In spite of the more representative role given to dynamic intransitive events, non-
dynamic or stative events are prominent among intransitives. They are events where the subject 
experiences an effect or state that comes from their own potential or tendency to experience it. 
Under this definition many subtypes of verbs can be included: emotions and their expression 
(e.g. kushi- ‘to be happy,’ waqa- ‘to cry,’ tiqna- ‘to be bored; to be fed up’), resulting states (illa- 
‘to be absent; to disappear,’ chichu- ‘for an animal to be pregnant,’ macha- ‘to be drunk’), and 
inherent states (e.g. lasa- ‘to weight,’ alala:- ‘to be cold,’ ana:- ‘to be hard,’ pishi- ‘to be short 
of; to be not enough,’ and qamla- ‘to be insipid’). Furthermore, numerous spontaneous events 
expressing a change are seen in HQ as caused by their experiencing subjects (e.g. wanu- ‘to die,’ 
puwa- ‘to boil,;’ wayu- ‘to have abundant fruit, bear fruit,’ ismu- ‘to rot,’ and timpu- ‘to cook 
slowly’). 
Thus, many verbs listed as transitive in dictionaries because they can take a direct object 
are poor examples of transitivity. For instance, taki- ‘to sing,’ ni- ‘to say,’ and yaski- ‘to answer’ 
have their object (physical or cognitive) created through an action depending upon the subject 
itself. This is also the case for so-called transitive events with cognate direct objects (e.g. pirqa- 
‘to build a wall,’ from pirqa ‘wall,’ and uchku- ‘to make a hole,’ from uchku ‘hole’). 
In sum, intransitive verbs are quite diverse and widespread in HQ. From a conceptual 
perspective, intransitivity is as prominent as transitivity. In my corpus I have counted 469 
intransitive roots (including spontaneous, atmospheric, stative, verbs of emission, and those with 
cognate objects, besides typical dynamic actions) against 522 transitive roots. Intransitivity is, 
then, not significantly less represented in the lexicon. 
 
4.6.2 Verbal derivation 
There are 18 derivational suffixes that modify the basic meaning of the verbs stem. They can be 
classified as belonging to the categories of aspect, voice, and general manner (including 
direction, coverage of the action, and attention and carefulness). Based on their position and 
interaction with other suffixes (e.g. vowel lowering, see Section 4.3.4.3), the verbal plural suffix 
-ya: and the 1st person object suffix -ma: should be considered derivational suffixes. However, 
they will be described under inflection. Derivation always precedes inflection. While not 
obligatory, derivational suffixes are frequently present following a mostly strict patterning, but 
not without exceptions and alternations. Moreover, their combination creates complex and subtle 
meaning distinctions.   
 
4.6.2.1 Aspect 
Aspect can be easily classified in two main areas: imperfective (time-unbounded events) and 
perfectives (time-bounded ones). HQ has a rich aspectual system with many further distinctions. 
 
4.6.2.1.1 Imperfectives 
4.6.2.1.1.1 -yka: ‘continuous (IPFV)’ 
The most basic imperfective marker is continuous aspect -yka: (shortened to -yka when followed 
by a consonant in syllabic coda). It can be described as a progressive when combined with 
dynamic events. An example illustrating is use is in (48). 
 
(48)  Pintiykarqayki. 
 {pinti-yka:-rqa-yki} 
 jump-IPFV-PST-2.SBJ 
‘You were jumping.’ 
 
However, -yka: frequently combines with stative events to indicate that the situation is 
effectively going on, as in Example (49). For this reason, this suffix is best viewed as encoding 
continuous aspect.14 
 
(49)  Ama mantsaka:yaytsu, nuqaqa kawayka:mi. 
{ama  mantsa-ka:-ya-y-tsu   nuqa-qa  kawa-yka:-ː-mi} 
PROH fear-SPON-PLV-IMP-NEG I-TOP  live-IPFV-1.SBJ-EVD 
‘Don’t be scared, I am alive.’ (Lit. ‘I am living’) 
 
 
14 This characterization is indebted to Hintz’s (2011) analysis of -yka: as continuous aspect in Southern Conchucos 
Quechua. 
Finally, it is frequent to use -yka: to introduce some implicit temporal boundaries to the event 
(i.e. an event is viewed as taking place as of a certain period), as in Example (50).  
 
(50) Kananqa yachaykan Yungaychaw. 
  {kanan-qa yacha-yka:-n  yungay-chaw} 
 now-TOP reside-IPFV-3.SBJ yungay-LOC 
 ‘She is currently living in Yungay.’ 
  
4.6.2.1.1.2 -ykacha ‘iterative (ITER)’ 
This aspectual suffix alternates with -kacha and it indicates that an event is done in a repetitive 
way. However, even if the event is composed of several episodes, it is different from the habitual 
aspect. -ykacha suggests that the event is divided into shorter episodes that are carried out in an 
unfocused manner, which makes their distribution somewhat unpredictable. Therefore, it 
suggests an action done carelessly (e.g. rika-ykacha- ‘to take a look around, here and there,’ 
from rika:- ‘to see,’ puklla-ykacha- ‘to play around,’ from puklla- ‘to play’). 
   
4.6.2.1.1.3 -ra: ‘durative (DUR)’ 
This suffix reduces to -ra when followed by a consonant in syllabic coda. It indicates that an 
event is extending through time without interruption. Thus, the durative aspect is commonly 
associated with states or actions done in ways that extend beyond normal, particularly resulting 
states (e.g. puñu-ra:- ‘to stay asleep,’ from puñu- ‘to sleep,’ apari-ra:- ‘to remain carrying 
something on the back,’ from apari- ‘to carry on the back’). This resultative sense is somewhat 
implicit in the way the event is presented: the subject remains doing or experiencing what the 
verbs indicates for an extended period. This leads to -ra: being used as a resultative passive 
voice, although restricted to transitive verbs whose object experiences a change in position or 
location. This is illustrated in the Example in (51). 
 
(51)  kiri: wichqaran. 
 {kiri-ː   wichqa-ra:-n} 
 wound-1.POSS  close-DUR-3.SBJ 
 ‘My wound remains closed.’ (cf. kiri-ː-ta wicha- ‘to open my wound’) 
 
Finally, -ra: is frequently found combined with -yka: as -rayka:. The meaning of the 
combination is perfectly predictable from its parts: it indicates that a continuous event extends 
beyond what is assumed to be its basic implicit boundary. However, because -rayka: is always 
placed before the causative suffix -tsi, even when -yka: can occur before or after -tsi, it can be 
considered a fused form. 
 
(52)  I wayichawqa arupakurayka:yan. I warmi cha:rin mana kasashpa. 
{I  wayi-chaw-qa   aru-paku-ra:-yka:-ya-n 
and  house-LOC-TOP cook-ATTEN-DUR-IPFV-PLV-3.SBJ  
I  warmi   cha:-ri-n   mana  kasa-shpa} 
and  woman  arrive-PUNC-3.SBJ not marry-SUBIS   
‘And in the house, they kept cooking (for the party). And the woman arrived without 
being married.’ 
 
4.6.2.1.2 Perfectives 
4.6.2.1.2.1 -ri ‘punctual (PUNC)’ 
The most basic perfective marker in HQ is punctual -ri. It indicates that an event takes place in a 
brief and immediate manner. It is very frequently found with events that involve a quick change 
(e.g. qimtsi- ‘to close eyes’ > qimtsi-ri- ‘to blink,’ from qimtsi- ‘to close eyes´,’ or tupa-ri- ‘to 
bump into,’ from tupa- ‘to run into’). Other examples showing how -ri conveys shorter duration 
and immediate occurrence are  pa:tsa-ri- ‘to lay down’ (from patsa:- ‘to lay on the ground’), 
rika:-ri- ‘to notice; to glance’ (from rika:- ‘to see’), yarpa-ri- ‘to recall’ (from yarpa- ‘to 
remember’), cha:-ri- ‘to get there’ (from cha:- ‘to arrive’), ayllu-ri- ‘to get together’ (from ayllu- 
‘to gather’). 
By conveying a punctual event, -ri marks the event as complete. However, this is not the 
same as completive aspect, where an event develops thoroughly to completion. Instead, -ri 
profiles the minimal instance of an event that can be considered complete. Consider hita- ‘to 
throw.’ Its broad meaning gets refined through the punctual aspect, so in Example (53), hita-ri- 
points at the final step in the process of throwing something (i.e. ‘to expulse’): 
 
(53)  Tsaytanash hitaraya:mun linu yakuta upurir. 
{tsay-ta-na-sh   hita-ri-ya:-mu-n   linu yaku-ta  upu-ri-r 
DEM-ACC-DISC-EVR throw-PUNC-PLV-CISL-3SBJ flax water-ACC drink-PUNC-SUBIS 
‘Then they expulse it [the fetus] by drinking flax water.’ 
 
This example also shows the combination of a subordinating suffix -r with -ri. Subordinating 
suffixes are immediately preceded by this aspectual suffix to indicate that the event in the 
subordinate clause is completed. This is evidence of the basic perfective status of -ri. 
With stative or copulative verbs -ri profiles the point in which a state or experience comes to be, 
as in Example (54). 
 
(54)  Ichikllachawmi imayka karin.  
{ichik-lla-chaw-mi  imayka  ka-ri-n}  
little-LIM-LOC-EVD any.type be-PUNC-3.SBJ 
‘In a little bit, anything comes up.’ (i.e. ‘problems appear.’) 
 
Example (54) could be considered an example of the inceptive or inchoative function of -ri. 
However, my observations agree with Parker’s (1973a: 20) position that this suffix does not 
clearly convey the initial stage of an event. The inceptive function of -ri is the result of focusing 
on an abbreviated and perfective construal of the event. In Examples (53) and (54) -ri portrays 
those events as punctual changes. However, they are no equivalent to the beginning of those 
events. The inceptive function is best represented through a construction involving the auxiliary 
qalla- ‘to begin’ and the same subject subordinator -r (see Section 4.8.4.2.3.1, and Examples 107 
and 176 in Sections 4.6.2.3.1 and 4.8.4.2.3.1 respectively) 
 
4.6.2.1.2.2 -yku ‘exceptional performance (EXCEP)’ 
One of the most frequently used suffixes in HQ is -yku. Its meaning is notoriously difficult to 
pinpoint, not only for this Quechuan variety (see Chapter 5 by Aviva Shimelman in this volume 
for Yauyos Quechua). Its origin is in a directional non-productive suffix -yku ‘inwards and 
downwards motion.’ With this function it is only found with lexicalized verbs (e.g. yayku- ‘to 
enter’) and a few motion events (e.g. muchki-yku- ‘to bow down and into something,’ from 
muchki- ‘to bow.’) 
Parker (1973a: 22–3) proposes that the directional sense of -yku is part of a Proto-
Quechua directional paradigm based on the use of the proto-verb *ya- ‘to be at; to move into.’ 
Alongside yayku- ‘to enter,’ there are forms like yarku- ‘to go up,’ yarqu- ‘to exit,’ and yarpu- 
‘to go down.’ Thus, -yku ‘into,’ -rku ‘up,’ -rqu ‘out,’ and -rpu ‘down’ can be reconstructed.15 -
rpu ‘down’ is seldom used with its directional sense and it has not developed in HQ an aspectual 
function.16 On the other hand, -rku ‘up’ and -rqu ‘out’ are still found with their directional sense 
in limited instances of motion event; however, like -yku ‘into,’ they have evolved into new 
functions, an  aspectual for -rku and a tense reading for -rqu  (see Sections 4.6.2.1.2.3 and 
4.6.3.2.3.) 
Based on the modal or subjective undertones it gives to an event, Parker (1973a: 34–5, 
1976: 129) and Swisshelm (1974: 499–504) describe -yku not as an aspectual marker. It can 
express carefulness, hastiness, unexpectedness, politeness, adverseness, or some type of 
particular importance or effort when carrying out the event. The following examples illustrate the 
frequent use in commands (Example 55), a special way of behaving (Example 56, based on the 
copula ka- ‘to be’), an adversative/accidental punctual event (Example 57), and an action carried 
out after no previous expectations (Example 58).

‘Fortunately, he opened (the door) for me.’ (Context: The narrator had gone to a place he 
was supposed lodge, but no one opened, so he goes unannounced to another friend’s 
place, and he opens his door.) 
 
 
15 Other verbs that display the full directional paradigm of Proto Quechua are qayku- ‘to put into a pen,’ qarku- ‘to 
hill a plant to earth up,’ qarqu- ‘to expel,’ and qarpu- ‘to push down’. Parker and Chávez Reyes (1976: 138) 
propose *qa- with the meaning ‘to make go.’ 
16  In Southern Conchucos Quechua, -rpu has developed a clear perfective-completive aspectual function (Hintz 
2011: 27–9). 
The diverse readings of -yku aside, it must be stressed that it is a perfective marker. This can be 
inferred from its complementary distribution with continuous the continuous aspect suffix-yka:. 
They are never found in the same verb (unless -yku is used with its non-productive directional 
sense). Even if perfective -rku also is in complementary distribution with -yka: (see Section 
4.6.2.1.2.3), it also cannot combine with -yku. From this evidence, it can be proposed that -yku 
must be a perfective whose meaning is also opposed to that of -rku.17 
The combination of modal/subjective interpretations and its perfective nature suggests 
that -yku is actually a durative telic aspect (i.e. an accomplishment): the event is presented as 
requiring some duration that leads to its endpoint (its perfective boundary).  
The implicit duration in -yku has experienced several semantic extensions. First, it is 
linked to the effort it takes to go through the process in order to reach the result. This can be read 
as carefulness, emphasis, higher than normal degree in what is done, or any intensified 
subjectivity associated with the event. From this focus on the duration, it is possible to move into 
the notion of ‘contrary to what it is expected.’ Aditionally, an event marked for the effort it 
requires is easily recruited as a politeness device (the speaker uttering the command 
acknowledges how a subject will do something that costs them an unexpected effort, hence the 
‘please’ translation). In sum, the “duration-as-effort” meaning of -yku extends to a politeness 
function, and a “contrary-to-expectation” meaning. From there, it moves on to include the 
‘unexpected outcome’ (without referring to the basic duration of the event). This motivates the 
use of -yku with accidental situations, as in Example (57) and, arguably also Example (58). 
 
4.6.2.1.2.3 -rku ‘perfective of achievement (UW)’ 
The suffix -rku originates in the locational suffix *-rku ‘upwards motion’ (see Section 
4.6.2.1.2.2.). From this meaning, now restricted to motion events (e.g. hita-rku- ‘to throw 
upwards,’ from hita- ‘to throw’), and a few lexicalized verbs (yarku- ‘to go up,’ qarku ‘to hill 
plants; to earth up.’) As an aspectual marker, the meaning of -rku is directly opposite to that of 
the perfective of emphasis function of the exceptional performance marker -yku discussed in 
Section 4.6.2.1.2.3. It conveys a punctual telic aspect (i.e. an achievement). Since there is no 
need to imply the duration of the event, the results are achieved without reference to any effort 
implied in the process. This semantic characteristic of -rku was first elaborated in Parker (1973a: 
23–6). He concluded that -rku expressed an event that is completed “without resistance.” 
Examples (59) – (61) illustrate the way in which -rku is used. 
 
(59)  Pukyuman cha:rirnash yakuta chaqarkamun.

{shimi-n-ta  hira-rku-pu-rqu-naq} 
mouth-3.POSS-ACC sew-UW-BEN-REC.PST-NARR.PST 
‘He sewed his mouth up.’ 
 
 
17 These arguments for the aspectual nature of -yku were first exposed for Southern Conchucos Quechua in Hintz 
(2011), who followed intuitions about the distribution of -yku in Huallaga Quechua from Weber (1989). Hintz 
(2011) considers -yku a “completive-perfective” that implies an obligation.

 {kumpari  ma:   upu-rku-shun} 
 compadre  come.on drink-UW-1PL.INCL.SBJ.FUT  
  ‘Compadre, come on, let’s drink (up).’ 
 
These examples confirm that -rku conveys an action carried out in a straightforward manner. 
Completion is achieved with little effort or resistance that could delay or make the action 
difficult. With stative events -rku indicates that the event is fully experienced, as shown in 
Example (62).

Observe how in Examples (63) and (64) apa-yku-r is connected to something done under 
pressure, while apa-rku-r points at an event done under the acceptance of everyone involved.

In contrast with -ri and -yku, which combine productively, -ri and -rku do not.18 Being already a 
type of punctual aspect, it is incompatible with -ri. However, despite its clear punctual perfective 
nature, -rku can be found with durative aspect -ra: and with iterative -ykacha. This is impossible 
for -yku, which rejects any imperfective. For instance, among several examples with -ykacha, we 
have chunka-kacha-rku- ‘to roll something around’ (from chunka- ‘to roll by pushing’), or 
hicha-kacha-rku- ‘to throw away,’ ‘to wastefully discard something’ (from hita- ‘to throw’). 
With durative -ra: only chukru-ra:-rku- ‘to stay hardened up’ (from chukru- ‘to be hard’) is 
registered. This type of data needs further analysis.  
 
4.6.2.2 Voice 
Voice suffixes in HQ includes those in charge of altering the valency in the verb, as well as the 
grammatical relations of their arguments. Valency increasing suffixes are -tsi ‘causative,’  -pu 
‘benefactive,’ and -pa: ‘applicative.’ On the other hand, -ku ‘reflexive, middle, medio-passive, 
passive,’ -naku ‘reciprocal,’ and -ka: ‘passive, accidental’ can reduce valency. However, as for 
aspect, voice suffixes tend to convey subtle alternative ways in which the event is developed by

their participants. Those interpretations are many times at odds with their assumed basic valency-
altering function. 
 
4.6.2.2.1 -tsi ‘causative (CAUS)’ 
Causative voice is marked with -tsi, which introduces a participant in the subject position with 
the role of causer, the ultimate responsible for the occurrence of the event. As is common in 
many Quechuan languages, the causer does not need to forcefully enact causation upon the 
affected participant (direct causation). It is possible for it to simply let the event to occur 
(permissive causation). Moreover, the causer can also act through a proxy or in any other way 
that separates them from the exact moment in which the caused effect occurs (indirect 
causation). These types of causation are exemplified in Examples (65) – (67) with wanu- ‘to die,’ 
with Example (65) showing direct causation, Example (66) permissive causation, and Example 
(67) indirect causation.

‘They killed the cat along with her kittens.’ (Context: The enemies of the cat chopped

The participant affected by the caused event is the causee. There are different ways in which the 
causee relates to the causer, and this is reflected in the morphosyntax of causatives. First, the 
most basic and frequent causative construction uses an intransitive verb. Examples (65) – (67) 
illustrated this with the spontaneous intransitive verb wanu- ‘to die.’ Example (68) uses a motion 
event. 
 
(68)  Kallu Shantita pintitsiykan.  
{kallu shanti-ta pinti-tsi-yka:-n} 
 carlos santiago-ACC jump-CAUS-IPFV-3.SBJ 
 ‘Carlos is making Santiago jump.’ 
 
This basic construction is frequently extended to transitive verbs in order to express that the 
causer gets the caused event done, as in the Examples in (69) and (70). 
 
(69)  Huwanshi runkukunata paka:tsirqan.

Mom-EP-1.POSS bread-ACC buy-CAUS-REC.PST-3.SBJ 
‘My mom had bread be bought.’ (or ‘she ordered bread to be bought’) 
 
The basic function of causativity in those examples is to express that the subject gets something 
done and the means by which this happens are not relevant: there is no need to mention any other 
participant besides the causer and the direct object of the verb. Thus, a transitive verb marked 
with -tsi is close in meaning to a spontaneous or passive event because their agent is defocused. 
However, if the agent in the caused event must be overt, HQ, as is the case in other Quechuan 
languages, can code it as a secondary causer through comitative-instrumental case -wan. This 
secondary causer does not oppose the control of the causer, making it an unaffected participant. 
Example (71) illustrates this.  
 
(71)  Ana paninwan waytata apatsirqan. 
{ana  pani-n-wan     wayta-ta  apa-tsi-rqa-n} 
ana sister.of.a.woman-3.POSS-COM flower-ACC take-CAUS-PST-3.SBJ 
‘Ana had her sister take a flower.’ 
 
As in Example (72), this construction can also be used with any intransitive verb.  
 
(72)  Allquta puritsin yanaqinwan. 
{allqu-ta  puri-tsi-n   yanaqi-n-wan} 
dog-ACC  walk-ACC-3.SBJ  friend-3.POSS-COM 
‘She has her friend walk the dog.’ 
 
Another way to code what appears to be a secondary causer is through accusative -ta. In this 
case, this participant not a secondary causer, but a causee: they are forced to carry out the event. 
Thus, they oppose the causer’s control, which makes them an affected participant. Example (73) 
illustrates. 
 
(73)  Ana paninta waytata apatsirqan. 
 {ana  pani-n-ta     wayta-ta  apa-tsi-rqa-n} 
ana sister.of.a.woman-3.POSS-ACC flower-ACC take-CAUS-PST-3.SBJ 
‘Ana made her sister take a flower.’ 
 
It is impossible to use this type of construction with an intransitive verb. Since intransitive verbs 
have only one participant, their argument structure cannot accommodate two affected ones. This 
suggests that this is a double accusative construction where the first object (panin-ta ‘her sister-
ACC’) is the most prominently affected participant, while the other object (wayta-ta ‘flower-
ACC’) is analogous to the theme in ditransitive constructions.  
 
4.6.2.2.2 -ku ‘middle (MID)’ 
The suffix -ku is not only the most frequently used derivational suffix in HQ, but the most 
polysemous one. This suffix is present in every Quechuan language, and in most of them it is 
labeled as “reflexive” (e.g. by Aviva Shimelman in Chapter 5 of this volume for Yauyos 
Quechua and by Jairo Valqui and Aviva Shimelman in Chapter 6 for Chachapoyas Quechua). 
This is also the case in many descriptions of HQ (e.g. Swisshelm 1974: 479; Julca Guerrero 
2009a: 238), according to whom -ku indicates that the subject and object of a verb are co-
referential. This purported reflexive function is found in self-care actions such as those in 
Examples (74) – (76). 
 
(74)  Malli naqtsakuykan. 
{malli  naqtsa-ku-yka:-n} 
maría comb-MID-IPFV-3.SBJ 
‘María is combing (herself)’ 
 
(75)  Mayuchaw armakurqantsik.

(76)  Bruhoqa hampikurqan. 
{bruho-qa  hampi-ku-rqa-n} 
shaman-TOP cure-MID-PST-3.SBJ 
‘The shaman healed himself.’ 
 
Parker (1973a: 9) rejected the idea that -ku is a reflexive marker. Reflexivity requires an action 
that can only be carried out as if involving an external object participant, fully distinguishable 
from the subject. Under this basic definition, no actual reflexives can be linked to the used on -ku 
in HQ. First, grooming verbs are fully compatible with a body-part direct object. Thus, in the 
previous examples naqtsa- ‘to comb’ could take aqtsa-n-ta ‘hair-3.POSS-ACC’ or piqa-n-ta ‘head-
3.POSS-ACC,’ while hampi- ‘to cure’ could use rikra-n-ta ‘arm-3.POSS-ACC’ as its direct object. A 
verb like arma- ‘to bathe’ is best viewed as an event performed through the use of the subject’s 
entire body, like any other intransitive motion event. However, it could also take kuwirpu-n-ta 
‘body-3.POSS-ACC’ as its direct object and still be marked with -ku. Note that these possible 
direct objects are inalienable possessions of the subject. Thus, they cannot be considered external 
and fully distinguishable from the subject.  
Other verbs that have been used to exemplify reflexivity like kuchu-ku- ‘to cut oneself’ 
or rupa-ku- ‘to burn oneself’ do not yield true reflexive constructions. Their basic transitive 
action never gets to be transmitted upon a different direct object when a body part of the subject 
is affected. Crucially, all of the previous examples illustrate how anytime an inalienable object 
becomes affected, the subject becomes automatically affected too. Although not a true reflexive, 
kuchu-ku- ‘to cut oneself’ shows that -ku still reduces the transitive valency of an event by 
restricting the way this event is carried out to the subjects own body. Example (77) illustrates 
this even when an inalienable object is not involved. 
 
(77)  Tsay machay rurinllaman alli paka:kuyay. 
{tsay  machay  ruri-n-lla-man    alli  paka:-ku-ya-y} 
DEM cave   inside-3.POSS-LIM-ALL good hide-MID-PLV-IMP 
‘Hide yourselves well inside of that cave!’ 
 
Pa:ka- ‘to hide’ is transitive in HQ. However, pa:ka-ku- ‘to hide (oneself)’ involves a single 
participant doing the hiding. Since this action is done by moving into any location that serves as 
a hideout, it is not truly reflexive, but an intransitive construal of this event. One central function 
of -ku is to indicate that the subject is also the most affected participant. However, the subject 
must be at the same time responsible for what it experiences. The overlap of affectedness and 
control is automatic, and not obtained through a subject acting upon itself. Therefore, -ku is a 
middle voice marker that does not include reflexivity among its functions. Instead, it gives an 
event a meaning analogous to that of intransitive verbs. This middle construal of transitive verbs 
can be seen in paki-ku- ‘to experience a fracture’ (from paki- ‘to break something’) and alista-
ku- ‘to get ready’ (from alista- ‘to prepare something,’ a loan from Spanish).  
Another common function of -ku is to indicate the subject’s self-benefit. This involves a 
direct object that is external to the subject. In those cases, a middle interpretation is present 
because the direct object becomes a possession of the subject. Also, -ku emphasizes how this 
object produces a prominent affectedness in the subject, which becomes a beneficiary. This is 
shown in the examples in (78) and (79).

{puma  u:sha-ntsik-ta    apa-ku-rqu-n}

{Qam  mishki  aytsa-ta  miku-ku-nki} 
you  tasty meat-ACC eat-MID-2.SBJ 
‘You eat tasty meat.’ (Lit. ‘you eat for yourself’) 
 
There are virtually no restrictions in how -ku is used: it takes transitive or intransitive verbs, and 
it can be used with animate or inanimate beings (see Section 4.6.1.2 for a restriction in the use of 
-ku with caused motion transitive events). With intransitive verbs, and especially those in which 
the subject is an experiencer, -ku seems redundant. However, aywa-ku- (from aywa- ‘to go’), 
yacha-ku- (from yacha- ‘to know; to learn,’) and rika:-ku- (from rika:- ‘to see’) suggest that 
their subject performs with deliberate intention in connection with an enhancement of what is 
experienced. Thus, aywa-ku- means ‘to leave, go away,’ yacha-ku- ‘to study,’ and rika:-ku- ‘to 
watch something fun,’ i.e. ‘to spectate.’ 
A deliberate engagement reading of -ku is impossible with inanimate subjects. However, 
the basic middle function remains in that the subject has a clear tendency or propensity to 
experience the effects of a verb. Moreover, those effects are considered more prominent 
(complete, total, or even lasting for an extended period). In Example (80), -ku indicates that the 
floor (an inanimate entity) moved noticeably due to the effect of an earthquake: 
 
(80)  Ampipapis kada ratu kuyukarayka:murqan. 
{ampi-pa-pis   kada  ratu  kuyu-ku-ra:-yka:-mu-rqa-n} 
night-GEN-ADD every time move-MID-DUR-IPFV-CISL-PST-3.SBJ 
‘(The floor) at night kept moving there every time.’ 
 
The use of -ku to indicate the propensity of a subject to experience the effects of the event has 
evolved into imperfective aspectual functions such as conveying that the event is customary of 
the subject. This motivates the frequent association of the agentive nominalizer -q with -ku (e.g. 
yacha-tsi-q ‘one who teaches’ becomes yacha-tsi-ku-q ‘teacher, one who customarily teaches,’ 
from yacha-tsi- ‘to make learn’).19 
In sum, whatever its specific function, -ku indicates that the semantic roles of 
affectedness and control overlap on the subject participant. Moreover, -ku also emphasizes those 
roles by making them more prominent (i.e. adding deliberateness or propensity in inanimate 
subjects, as well as an effect that is subjectively stronger or more pronounced or long-lasting). 
My analysis is not much different from Parker’s (1973a): -ku emphasizes the role of the subject. 
However, this is a twofold role, based on (i) the subject’s control in the development of the event 
and on (ii) its affectedness in an event that never fully projects upon a different entity. 
 
4.6.2.2.3 -na and -ku ‘reciprocal (RECP)’ 
Reciprocals are closely related to the middle voice. Alongside the middle suffix -ku, they require 
the presence of the distributive suffix -na, which only functions in this construction. It indicates 
that the members of plural subject are acting reciprocally upon each other (e.g. maqa-naku- ‘to 
fight; to hit each other,’ from maqa- ‘to hit;’ riqi-naku- ‘to meet; to become acquainted with 
each other,’ from riqi- ‘to know, be acquainted’). 
While the combination -naku is the way in which this suffix is mostly used, it is possible 
to insert the causative suffix in between. This will produce different interpretations regarding 
where the reciprocal interaction occurs. 
 
(81)  I yanaqinkunawanqa llapanmi pampatsa:natsikuyan. 
{i  yanaqi-n-kuna-wan-qa  llapa-n-mi pampatsa:-na-tsi-ku-ya-n} 
and  friend-3.POSS-PL-COM-TOP all-3.POSS-EVD pair.up-RECP-CAUS-MID-PLV-3.SBJ 
‘And with their friends, all of themi makes each otheri match.’ 
 
In Example (81), pampatsa:-na-tsi-ku- ‘let each other pick a pair among themselves’ (from 
pampatsa:- ‘to even out; to match up’) includes the causative -tsi followed by -ku. This 
combination indicates that the subject allows something to happen to themselves (e.g. hayta-tsi-
ku- ‘to let oneself be kicked,’ from hayta- ‘to kick.’) Thus, in -na-tsi-ku the distributive scope of 
-na is restricted to those causing the event. On the other hand, pampa:tsa-tsi-naku- ‘to make 
each other match up with someone else’ suggests that the subjects are letting or making each pair 
up with another participant outside of the plural subject.  
 
4.6.2.2.4 -ka: ‘spontaneous (SPON)’ 
When followed by a consonant forming a syllabic coda, -ka: becomes -ka. This suffix has been 
documented in most Central Quechua varieties (the exception are the Huanca varieties in central 
and southern Junín), in Northern Peruvian varieties, and in Yauyos Quechua (see Chapter 5 by 
 
19 The aspectual function of -ku was extended to its extreme in Ecuadorian Kichwa, where -ku is effectively an 
imperfective aspect marker (Cole 1982). 
Aviva Shimelman in this volume, who labels it, in contrast to the analysis for HQ offered here, 
‘accidental’).  
For HQ, -ka: has been analyzed as a passive or semi-passive in all the previous 
grammatical descriptions. Accordingly, this suffix shows a clear preference to combine with 
transitive verbs. For instance, a transitive verb like paqa- ‘to wash’ yields paqa-ka:- ‘to be 
washed.’ Contrast the unmarked form, using kinwa ‘quinoa’ as the -ta marked direct object in 
Example (82), and the form with -ka:, where kinwa is the nominative subject, in Example (83). 
 
(82) Kinwata paqarqantsik. 
{kinwa-ta paqa-rqa-ntsik} 
quinoa-ACC wash-PST-1INCL.SBJ 
‘We washed the quinoa.’ 
 
(83) Kinwa paqakarqantsik. 
{kinwa  paqa-ka:-rqa-ntsik} 
quinoa  wash-SPON-PST-1INCL.SBJ 
‘The quinoa was washed.’ 
 
Paqa-ka:- suggests that the quinoa was washed, but there is no way to indicate a specific agent 
involved. Thus, the use of -ka: is similar to the English get-passive: the quinoa “got washed” 
because something happened that produced such change (e.g. rainfall). In fact, a definite animate 
individual serving as the agent is neither implied nor retrievable as an adjunct when -ka: is used. 
The sentence (83) could use an instrumental adjunct like tamya-wan ‘with the rain’ to indicate 
what caused the event, but this is unusual. 
An animate subject in a verb marked with -ka: is interpreted as not fully in control of the 
action they experience, as Example (84) shows. For this example, even a reflexive translation is 
possible.  
 
(84) Ashnu watakaykan.  
 {ashnu  wata-ka:-yka-n} 
 donkey  tie-SPON-CONT-3.SBJ 
 ‘The donkey is getting tied’ or ‘the donkey is getting itself tied.’ 
 
While many transitive verbs combine with -ka:, there are numerous instances of verbs where this 
suffix is never found or considered odd. This is particularly noticeable with verbs that specify a 
way of doing things that requires a sentient subject in care of the event. Thus, verbs like lapta- 
‘to touch with the hand,’ taki- ‘to sing,’ aru- ‘to work,’ muna- ‘to want,’ and qu- ‘to give’ are 
quite difficult to elicit with -ka: and never found in the corpus.20 
To sum up, -ka: combines interpretations where (i) no external causer can be clearly 
identified, particularly as an animate individual, (ii) the subject is clearly affected as a result of 
the event taking place, (iii) it is possible to assign some level of responsibility to the subject, 
particularly if it is animate, however (iv) this responsibility (i.e. the subject’s control) seems to 
be hampered or diminished.  
Based on those characteristics, -ka: is best defined as spontaneous voice. This type of 
voice is conceptually related to other passive constructions (cf. Shibatani 1985; Toyota 2011). 
 
20 These restrictions can be overturn by the impersonal function of -ka:, as shown further below in this section. 
Canonical passive voices (e.g., John was seen) promote the patient argument of the active voice 
to the subject position, which leaves their original agent argument implicit. On the other hand, 
spontaneous voice constructions introduce a subject that experiences the event due to some 
external factor in the background. This factor is never an individual, but some force, situation, or 
context triggering the event experienced by the subject. Furthermore, the subject must find itself 
in a condition that makes it susceptible to experience the change brought by the external factor. 
In Example (85), a fox had his mouth stitched by a trickster bird. After walking around in pain 
for some time (the external factor), the stitches loosened up and the fox’s mouth tore open. This 
is represented by lliki-ka:- (from lliki- ‘to tear a thin surface’): 
 
(85)  I tsayna shimin llikika:kurinaq allibuwenu hatun. 
{i  tsay-na  shimi-n  lliki-ka:-ku-ri-naq     
and  DEM-DISC  mouth-3.POSS  tear-SPON-MID-PUNC-NARR.PST   
allibwenu  hatun} 
very  big 
‘And then his mouth tore open very big.’ 
 
-ka: also conveys true reflexivity in HQ. This means that it is used with transitive verbs 
representing events that strongly imply a transmission of force from one participant onto another. 
Thus, in order to reduce the valency of a prototypical transitive verb, only -ka: is used, not -ku. 
Reflexive uses of -ka: are common for caused motion events. Examples are chura-ka:- ‘to put 
oneself’ (from chura- ‘to put’), suta-ka:- ‘to stretch oneself, extend one’s own body’ (from suta- 
‘to pull something’), and ayllu-ka:- ‘to get together, form an assembly’ (from ayllu- ‘to group 
things’). Example (86) provides further illustration.

child   basket-ALL  fill-SPON-REC.PST-NARR.PST 
‘The child got herself into the basket.’ (Lit. ‘filled herself into the basket’) 
 
The impersonal function of -ka: is the only way in which an animate agent can by implied in an 
otherwise spontaneous event. In impersonal situations, it is assumed that someone must have 
carried out the event, but its identity is irrelevant. With this function, any transitive verb can take 
-ka:. This seems to be a recent development in this variety, and it is found with some regularity 
in formal texts as in Example (87), perhaps under the influence of Spanish 
 
(87)  Ayan llapan hirkapa ashikaykayarqan. 
{aya-n  llapan  hirka-pa  ashi-ka:-yka:-ya:-rqa-n-mi} 
corpse-3.POSS all-3.POSS mountain-GEN look.for-SPON-IPFV-PLV-PST-3.SBJ-EVD 
‘His corpse was sought through all the mountains.’ 
 
Finally, although -ka: is generally associated with transitive verbs, it can be found with some 
intransitive verbs. Those cases have been regularly described as idiomatic expressions and 
deemed exceptional. Examples are punu-ka:- ‘to fall asleep’ (from punu- ‘to sleep’), wanu-ka:- 
‘to wilt; to be exhausted’ (from wanu- ‘to die’), and yacha-ka:- ‘to become accustomed’ (from 
yacha- ‘to know’). Other apparent lexicalized, and quite frequent, forms are mantsa-ka:- ‘to get 
scared’ (from mantsa- ‘to fear something’) and usha-ka:- ‘to get finished.’ With the exception of 
yacha-ka:- ‘to become accustomed to,’ all of these forms imply an adversative result. In other 
words, something overcame the subject and led to this result. In my corpus, there are at least 50 
other cases of intransitive verbs and nouns that can take -ka: (to mention only a couple, tsaki-
ka:- ‘to heal a wound by forming a scab,’ from tsaki- ‘to be dry,’ and pasa-ka:- ‘to pass a long 
time,’ from pasa- ‘to pass’). Virtually all of them combine the passing of time as the most 
common external factor with an adversative result. 
 
4.6.2.2.5 -pu ‘benefactive (BEN)’ 
This suffix alternates with -pa due to vowel lowering when followed by the cislocative suffix -
mu and the 1st person object marker -ma: (see Section 4.3.4.3). The main function of -pu  is to 
introduce an extra participant besides the basic arguments of a verb. This participant is 
interpreted as prominently affected by being the beneficiary or maleficiary of the event.21 In this 
sense, -pu introduces not only a goal of an event, but a highly affected one. The Examples in (88) 
– (90) illustrate the use of -pu.

{Hushi  mama-n-paq   wayi-n-ta  rura-pu-n} 
José   mother-3.POSS-DAT house-3.POSS-ACC make-BEN-3.SBJ

person-TOP  pick-UW-BEN-CISL-REC.PST-3.SBJ one gold ax-ACC 
‘The person picked up a golden ax for him.’ 
 
The way in which -pu introduces the affected participant is based on the object person system 
(see Section 4.6.3.1.2). Thus, -pu uses -shu-nki to indicate that a 2nd person is the beneficiary in 
Example (89), while in Example (90) -pu refers to an unmarked 3rd person object. However, 
contrary to what we would expect, in Example (88) the overt beneficiary is not introduced by an 
object marked with the accusative suffix -ta, instead -paq is used (mama-n-paq ‘for his mother’). 
It appears as if only the basic direct object is marked with -ta, not the beneficiary.  
-pu is also frequently used with the copula ka- to express possession. The beneficiary 
marked with -pu is the possessor for whom something exists (see Section 4.6.1.1).  
There are two possible positions for -pu among derivational suffixes. In the examples 
above, it is in the second position. There, it can be preceded by aspect suffixes, the causative -tsi, 
and the inflectional verbal plural -ya:. In this position, its interpretation is based on the existence 
of an additional affected participant. However, when -pu takes the position next to the verbal 
stem, it implies that the event produces a negative or adversative affectedness towards a non-
 
21 Authors like Parker (1973a: 17) used the term “interpersonal” in order to avoid the positive connotation associated 
with “beneficiary.” However, due to its more widespread used in the literature, I will use the latter. 
subject participant. An adversely affected direct object is introduced in Example (91), while in 
(92), the adverse reading of -pu applies to the core direct object or tari- ‘to find:’22

wife-3.POSS mistress-3.POSS-COM find-BEN-EXCEP-NARR.PST 
‘Hisi wife caught himi with hisi mistress.’ 
 
Finally, the combination between -pu and -ku has three interpretations. First, it can convey that 
an action is carried out for the benefit of the subject in a way that is against the interests of 
another participant. This is an adversative reading. Thus miku- ‘to eat’ yields miku-pu-ku- ‘to eat 
someone else’s food; to drop uninvited to eat at someone’s place,’ and punu- ‘to sleep’ yields 
punu-pu-ku- ‘to crash at someone’s place.’ The second interpretation is based on transitive 
events that imply both self-benefit for the subject and benefit for a third-party. Thus, naqtsa- ‘to 
comb (someone)’ yields naqtsa-pu-ku- ‘to cut hair for a living,’ and urya- ‘to work’ yields urya-
pu-ku- ‘to work (as an employee).’ This could be related to the customary action function of the 
middle -ku (see Section 4.6.2.2.2). Finally, -pu-ku- also indicates that an adverse or unexpected 
situation is brought upon an object and a subject, but due to the subject’s own responsibility. 
Thus, as expected in a middle voice, the subject is both the affected participant and the main 
responsible for what happens. However, the presence of -pu determines that what the subject 
experiences is whatever a beneficiary (or maleficiary) does. Examples (93) and (94) illustrate the 
contrast between a malefactive reading of -pu and the third function of -pu-ku, which conveys an 
adverse or unexpected situation that affects both the subject and an object:

22 Parker (1976: 118) presents a different instance of a suffix -pu and labels it “directive.” According to this author, 
this suffix only combines with verbs of bodily emission. Thus ishpa- ‘to urinate,’ isma- ‘to defecate,’ and tuqa- ‘to 
spit’ yield ishpa-pu-, isma-pu-, and tuqa-pu-, respectively. Clearly these cases are instances of adding -pu in the 
closest position to the stem to obtain an adversative interpretation: the subject has the intention to soil (or even to 
show contempt for) the target of those emissions. 
‘They say that, in order to have someone die on them, their cigarette gets a hole.’ 
(Context: Shamans cast a deadly spell by smoking their cigarettes in a way that it gets a 
hole. If this happens, their enemies will die, which benefits the shamans.) 
 
4.6.2.2.6 -pa: ‘applicative (APPL)’ 
This suffix loses its long vowel when followed by a consonant in a syllabic coda. However, in 
the Huaraz province it is frequent to find -pa alternating freely with -pa:. The only stable 
manifestation of -pa seems to be in the fused form -paku (see Section 4.6.2.3.5).  
-pa: has been described as conveying a repetitive, intermittent event, a careful or slow 
action, or an action directed to another participant (analogous to the benefactive suffix -pu). In 
addition to this, it can involve several affected objects. Clear aspectual properties for -pa: have 
been proposed (Julca Guerrero 2009a: 240 and Parker 1976: 123–5). In the Examples in (95) – 
(97) the iterative function is illustrated:

 ‘She shook her son saying: ‘wake up.’’                         (Larsen 1976: 4) 
 
The directional function of -pa: is most apparent with verbs of emotion and communication. The 
former are considered typically intransitive, and the latter are arguably lower in their semantic 
transitivity. Examples of the directional function include e.g., asi-pa:- ‘to laugh at; to mock 
someone,’ from asi- ‘to laugh,’ aha-pa:- ‘to scold someone,’ from aha- ‘to feel mad,’ anku-pa:- 
‘to feel compassion towards someone,’ from anku- ‘to feel nostalgic; to miss,’ tapu-pa:- ‘to 
question, inquire,’ from tapu- ‘to ask,’ or parla-pa:- ‘to talk to someone, to chat with,’ from 
parla- ‘to talk.’ Some uses of -pa: are listed in the dictionaries as lexicalizations too (e.g. 
taripa:- ‘to catch up with someone,’ from tari- ‘to find,’ or yachapa:- ‘to imitate, mimic,’ from 
yacha- ‘to know; to learn.’) Many cases of -pa:, however, do not fit the previous descriptions. In 
Example (98), kuti- ‘to go back,’ a motion verb, takes -pa: without involving any iteration, 
carefulness, several affected objects, or a directional function: 
 
(98)  Tsaytanam kutipantsik huk killatanaw, mas allpan ayllupashpana i qurakunataqa  hina 
ushaka:tsishpa. 
{tsay-ta-na-m   kuti-pa:-ntsik   huk  killa-ta-naw,   mas

‘Later, we come back approximately in a month, and we lump more dirt (around the 
plant) and in the same way we exterminate the weed.’ 
 
Here kuti-pa:- suggests an action done to take care of the plants. The subject returns due to some 
motivation, but it does not suggest ‘coming back again and again.’ It only states that 
approximately after a month they go back to hill the plants. Contrast this with ayllu-pa:- (from 
ayllu ‘to gather’) in the same sentence, where an iterative meaning is evident. The notion of a 
motivation behind the event helps better understand the function of -pa:. Example (99) shows 
how an intransitive stative verb such as lasa- ‘to weight’ takes -pa: in order to add an object that 
motivates an experience associated with the weight of the subject taklla ‘foot plow’: 
 
(99)  Takllaqa lasaparkunaq, Wallichuqa ninaq: “¿Imanirtaqshi taklla:qa lasapa:man?” 
{taklla-qa  lasa-pa:-rku-naq   wallichu-qa  ni-naq

why-CONTR-EVR foot.plow-1.POSS-TOP weight-APPL-1.OBJ-3.SBJ 
‘The foot plow weighted down on him, and Valentín said: ‘Why could it be my foot plow 
weighs me down?’’ 
 
lasa-pa:- ‘to weight’ seems to have a directional function in Example (99) because it points at 
the experiencer of the weight of the foot plow. However, such function falls under what -pu does 
(see Section 4.6.2.2.5, Example (94), wanu-pu- ‘to die on someone’). The reason why -pa: and 
not -pu is used in Example (99) is that the participant affected by the weight is not just receiving 
such weight; instead, the foot plow’s remarkable weight (the state it is in) comes from the 
perspective of the person feeling it (the 3rd person implicit direct object, and then -ma:, the 1st 
person direct object.) Thus, it is only out of the object’s experience that subject can be perceived 
in a certain state (in this case, as a particularly heavy foot plow).  
Every case of -pa: with an emotion or communication verb suggests that its object is the 
motivation behind what the subject does or experiences. Thus, asi-pa:- is not only ‘to laugh at 
something or someone that produces laughter:’ that participant must also be affected by the 
subject’s laughter. Likewise, tapu-pa:- is to ask someone because they are a source of 
information; but this questioning is impertinent or inquisitive, which affects the object serving as 
source. This directive function of -pa: is more productive than acknowledged by Parker (1976). 
For instance, it appears in medi-pa:-, from medi- ‘to measure.’ Even if someone receives what 
the subject measures, -pu is not used, as shown in Example (100). 
 
(100)  I imallatapis siemprish warminta medipa:kuykaq. 
{i  ima-lla-ta-pis   siempre-sh  warmi-n-ta   
and  what-LIM-ACC-ADD  always-EVR  woman-3.POSS-ACC   
medi-pa:-ku-yka:-q}  
measure-APPL-MID-IPFV-HAB 
‘And he was always measuring anything he gave to his wife.’  
 
The context for Example (100) is that a notoriously stingy man measured whatever he gave to his 
wife for cooking. By being given such limited ingredients she was very inconvenienced. Thus, 
medi-pa:- is not directional because the subject gives something that affects the object 
(beneficiary or maleficiary); instead, the subject is acting out of what he thinks the object 
deserves (i.e. is motivated by the object.) 
The applicative voice turns oblique participants expressing circumstantial notions into 
core arguments of a verb. I argue that in HQ -pa: is an applicative that turns a participant serving 
as motivation or source into a prominently affected participant. Therefore, -pa: is the opposite of 
benefactive -pu, which introduces a participant as an affected goal. This contrast is not too 
different from that between por and para in Spanish, which both mean ‘for,’ but the former 
closer to ‘due to,’ and the latter to ‘in order to.’ This subtle but real distinction can be 
confusing.23 
By considering -pa: an applicative introducing an affected source or motivation for the 
subject’s actions or experiences its iterative function can be accounted for: -pa: suggests that an 
event iterates as long as it is required to achieve what the affected participant motivated. This is 
exactly what the “careful action” function of -pa: suggests, but previous accounts failed to 
connect it to the iteration of the event. Thus, rika:-pa:-, from rika:- ‘to see,’ is ‘to watch 
carefully,’ which can be achieved by looking several times because of a reason that makes the 
subject pay such attention. 
Finally, the lack of a definition of -pa: in terms of its applicative voice function prevented 
previous accounts to recognize its conceptual proximity with the benefactive -pu. This made 
Parker (1973a, 1976) mistakenly identify some cases of -pa as lowering of -pu before the middle 
suffix -ku or the imperfective aspect marker -yka:. The only cases that correctly reflect -pu-
lowering are cases where it has a clear beneficiary reading, and it is followed by -ma:. All other 
examples Parker provides are either -pa: rendered as -pa because of vowel shortening (before -
yka:), or instances of -paku. The latter form clearly uses -pa with an applicative sense, but it 
seems to have been competing with -pu-ku, at least in the Huaraz province (see Section 
4.6.2.3.5.)24 In any case, all of those cases are uses of -pa: or a cognate conveying an affected 
source, and not cases of underlying -pu. 
 
4.6.2.3 Other derivational suffixes 
Here I include derivational suffixes like the cislocative -mu, the delimitative -lla:, and other 
forms that have a limited distribution like downward direction -rpu, stationary event -rpa:, 
attentive action -paku, and careful action -chaku.  
 
4.6.2.3.1 -mu ‘cislocative (CISL)’ 
As discussed in Section 4.3.4.3,-mu is one of the suffixes that trigger vowel change into /a/ in 
derivational suffixes ending with /u/ placed in any preceding position. This suffix indicates that 
 
23 It is likely that -pa: originates from *-pa-ya, a form that is commonly used in contrast with -pa in Southern 
Quechua varieties. In any case, the fact that -pa has taken over the functions of -pu in Huallaga Quechua (cf. Weber 
1989), or that in HQ adversative functions of -pu-ku are now virtually indistinguishable from -pa:-ku is evidence in 
favor of the strong connection between those two voice suffixes. 
24 Swisshelm (1974: 491) was the first to voice doubts about -pa: lowering to -pu before -ku. 
the event conveyed by the verbal stem is oriented towards the realm of a 1st person/speaker 
implicit in the sentence. This is not the same as “directed towards the subject” (which is 
associated with the middle -ku, see Section 4.6.2.2.2). With motion or caused-motion events its 
basic function is clear: apa-mu- ‘to bring’ (from apa- ‘to take; to carry’); ayllu-mu- ‘to gather 
and bring here’ (from ayllu- ‘to gather’); kuti-mu- ‘to come back’ (from kuti- ‘to return’). Motion 
events without -mu have their endpoint somewhere outside the realm of the 1st person. -mu is 
common with non-motion events, which makes them orient towards the speaker, as in the 
Examples in (101) or (102).

‘They have come looking for your sister.’ 
 
The 1st person does not need to be a physical endpoint, but it could be a psychological one. 
Therefore, the subject’s interest can motivate using -mu. This is central to its use with verbs 
where the 1st person is not directly or even obviously aimed in the motion, as in the Examples in 
(103) – (106) 
 
(103)  Qullqapita hicharpamurqun chuskun sakuta kachita i utsuta.

(106)  Sharayka:mu:mi. 
{sha-ra:-yka:-mu-ː-mi} 
come-DUR-IPFV-1.SBJ-EVD 
‘I am coming (for you)!’ 
 
Example (106) with shamu- ‘to come’ is revealing. -mu is virtually lexicalized to the stem *sha- 
(cognate with sha:- ‘to stand’). The position of -mu, however, can change in shamu-, particularly 
when the durative -ra: and imperfective -yka: suffixes appear, as seen in Example (106). The 
context of this sentence is as follows: A cougar has been challenged by a ram that wants to cross 
a bridge. The cougar is charging at the ram and says sharayka:mu:mi. Still, the actual motion 
moves away from where the speaker enunciates (the cougar is moving towards the ram). The 
cislocative suffix here implies the goal which the subject, who is also the speaker in (106), wants 
to reach. The reference point is construed in a subjective way, based on the speaker’s aim.  
This observation is crucial to other uses of -mu where it also indicates that, according to 
the speaker, the subject manages to do something. This is evident when the event’s occurrence is 
contrary to expectation, which affects in some way the speaker and those in their group. This is 
shown in the examples in (107) and (108). 
 
(107)  Warmikunapis, tomar qallaykuyan… machashqana, warmikuna qallaykaya:mun takirnin.

self-2.SBJ-ACC-EVD eat-FUT-1.SBJ.2.OBJ 
‘If tomorrow you don’t manage to find food, I will eat you and nobody but you.’ 
 
Furthermore, use of -mu as indicating that the subject manages what is denoted by the verb might 
be related to other uses of -mu where the action is regarded as urgent or pressing for the speaker. 
In this sense, -mu is still connected with the basic notion of an action moving towards the 
speaker, although in an entirely subjective way. In Example (109) the speaker is the one giving 
the command using -mu, tsariya:muy ‘you guys catch it!’ Nothing in the example suggests an 
actual motion towards the speaker. Instead, the speaker is interested in whatever the subjects in 
the imperative verb manage to do. Likewise, Example (110) indicates that the subject, who is 
also the speaker, is not simply going to spin something, but whatever they spin is motivated by a 
specific necessity pertaining to the speaker.

4.6.2.3.2  -lla: ‘limitative (LIM)’ 
This suffix seems to be the same as the limitative -lla for nominal derivation (see Section 
4.5.2.5). In a few sources, -lla: becomes -lla before a consonant in coda position, but mostly, this 
suffix is always -lla. Its function with verbs includes that of restricting the event to a single 
instance or type (miku-lla-nki ‘you will only eat,’ from miku- ‘to eat’). However, a subjective 
function is more frequently found: The action is viewed as less face-threatening, implying 
reservations towards another participant, and general politeness (e.g. yayku-lla:-ya-nki ‘you will 
come in, please,’ from yayku- ‘to enter,’ inflected with the verbal plural -ya: and -nki 2nd person 
future.) 
 
4.6.2.3.3  -rpu ‘downward (DW)’ 
This suffix is productive mainly, but not exclusively, with motion events. It indicates that the 
action is carried out downwards (e.g. yaka-rpu- ‘to store at the bottom,’ from yaka- ‘to put 
inside; to put away,’ cha-rpu- ‘to come down to,’ from cha:- ‘to arrive,’ qawa-rpu- ‘to watch 
downwards,’ from qawa- ‘to watch’). 
 
4.6.2.3.4 -rpa: ‘stationary (STN)’ 
This unproductive suffix indicates that the subject remains affected for a long time or 
permanently. Its use is marginal in my corpus (hita-rpa:- ‘to remain laying down,’ from hita- ‘to 
throw,’ and kicha-rpa:- ‘to remain open,’ from kicha- ‘to open’). Parker (1976: 120) records it as 
-rpa in a couple of roots beside hita- ‘to throw:’ chura-rpa- ‘to place oneself permanently,’ from 
chura- ‘to put,’ and hama-rpa- ‘to rest (as a group), from hama- ‘to rest,’ which indicates a 
collective action. -rpa:, like the durative suffix -ra:, produces a resultative passive: It makes the 
direct object of the base verb appear as subject experiencer (see Section 4.6.2.1.1.3). 
 
4.6.2.3.5 -paku ‘(ATTEN)’ 
According to Julca Guerrero (2009: 245) -paku has a function similar to that of -chaku (see 
Section 4.6.2.3.6): it indicates that the action is carried with special attention to a direct object 
that includes multiple details. However, this author suggests that -paku can refer also to an event 
performed without volition and circumstantially (e.g. wiya-paku- ‘to pay attention to any 
message,’ from wiya- ‘to hear,’ and rika-paku- ‘to look around with attention,’ from rika:- ‘to 
see.’)  
Larsen (1976: 7) is the only other author who considered -paku as an independent 
derivational suffix. In her view, this suffix suggests that the action has been carried to 
completion, done in a total manner, usually through multiple objects (something implied in Julca 
Guerrero’s previous definition). Examples (111) – (113) illustrate how a multiple object is fully 
affected, how a subject becomes a prominent experience through acting upon several objects, 
and how the subject is affected as a whole.

As Parker (1976: 123) noticed, -pa is non-existent as an independent suffix in HQ, and it 
alternates with -pa:, which is considered the base form in that variety. It is possible, then, that -
paku is but an alternation of -pa:ku. Compare Example (114) with (113) above: 
 
(114)  Alli aqshupa:kurkur hiqarinaq uqi punchurishqa nunawan. 
{alli  aqshu-pa:ku-rku-r   hiqari-naq  uqi  punchu-ri-shqa

nuna-wan} 
man-COM 
‘Wrapping up well (with her blanket), she left with the man in the grey poncho.’ 
 
Example (114) comes from a HQ author (and consultant) whose texts shows no alternation 
between -pa: and -pa (as found in corpus data from the Huaraz province). However, that very 
consultant still provides examples with -paku. The source participant in the event exists, but it is 
not prominently affected. As a source, it only provides some type of motivation (or support) for 
what the subject experiences. In this sense, paku is exactly what would be expected from the 
combination of -pa (different from -pa:, which requires an affected source-object) and -ku 
(which places affectedness on the controlling subject).

Perhaps the productive contrast that Parker (1976: 122, 124) found in Northern Conchucos 
Quechua between -pa (an action directed to multiple objects but not protracted, even immediate) 
and -pa: (virtually identical, but implying a protracted iteration) is still present in the 
combination -paku in HQ. It is as if the use of -pa involves the full use of a source that motivates 
or supports the action, without this involving a prominent affectedness of the source, as implied 
by -pa:. Clarifying if -paku is actually different from -pa:-ku requires further analysis. 
 
4.6.2.3.6 -chaku ‘(CARE)’ 
This suffix has an extremely reduced distribution, and it suggests that the action is done 
carefully, but also through repetition. In this regard, is similar to the applicative -pa: (see Section 
6.2.2.6). In my corpus it only appears as rika-chaku- ‘to spot; to descry’ (from rika:- ‘to see’) 
and as yarpa-chaku- ‘to deliberate,  reflect on,’ (from yarpa- ‘to remember’).  Other instances 
provided in previous works (Parker 1973a: 35 and Swisshelm 1974: 573) include wiya-chaku- 
(‘to be attentive to any sound,’ from wiya- ‘to hear’), apa-chaku- ‘to carry (a baby)’ (from apa- 
‘to carry’), and muski-chaku- ‘to snoop’ (from muski- ‘to smell.’) 
 
4.6.2.4 Order of derivational suffixes 
Table 4.11 shows my proposal for the default distribution of HQ derivational suffixes. While 
Parker (1973a) and Swisshelm (1974) provided the foundations for my analysis, several 
modifications have been introduced. 
 
<Insert table 11 here> 
 
In this table I include the plural suffix -ya: and the 1st  person object suffix -ma:. This is required 
because, even if these function as inflectional suffixes, their formal distribution is that of 
derivational ones. There are 12 slots, which are classified based on their overarching 
grammatical function (voice or aspect), their dynamic or stative meaning, or their specific 
function (plural, cislocative, and object marker.) The following list introduces clarifications on 
how to read table 4.11, as well as some specific restrictions that cannot be visually represented: 
(i) The distribution reads from left to right. For instance -pa:-ku, -ka:-ku, and -tsi-ku are 
valid combinations. *-ku-pa:, *-ku-ka:, and *-ku-tsi (i.e. -ka-tsi, with vowel lowering) 
are not.25 
(ii) A suffix’s meaning has scope over the items located to its left. 
(iii) Suffixes located one above the other, or in the same column do not combine. 
(iv) Suffixes in the same cell do not combine. This specifically applies to the “inverted-L” 
shaped cells covering columns one and two.  
(v) Suffixes in different colored zones do not combine with each other due to their 
inherent semantic incompatibility. 
 
25 Some exceptions can be found for -ku + -tsi (e.g.. pinqa-ka-tsi- ‘to make someone ashamed’), but they are few and 
likely to be lexicalized instances of -ku preceding the causative -tsi. 
(vi) Suffixes located in the dark gray zone can’t combine among them, even if they appear 
in different columns. For instance, with its directional meaning, the upward 
suffix -rku can’t combine with the benefactive -pu when it has an adversative 
meaning. Likewise, the outward suffix -rqu can’t combine with careful action -chaku, 
nor -ykacha, nor with directional -yku. 
(vii) Columns have been grouped based on their shared function: 
(a) Columns 1 and 2 contain suffixes located next to the verb stem. The light gray 
area includes those with a stative meaning that imply subject’s passive-like 
affectedness (-pa:, -ka:, -rpa:, -ra:, and -na:). The dark gray zone includes 
suffixes that indicate some dynamic and/or volitional meaning like direction of 
motion, as well as manner of activity.  
(b) Columns 3–5 include causative, reflexive, the reciprocal construction -naku, 
and the fused form -paku. They can be considered voice suffixes. The case of  
-paku as a fused suffix needs further study. 
(c) Columns 6 and 7 include suffixes that have a clear aspectual meaning: 
Perfective (-ri, -rku, and -yku) or basic imperfective (continuous -yka:) 
(d) Columns 9 and 12 include those suffixes that are best understood as 
inflectional in terms of their function, but that align with derivational ones due to 
their formal properties (the plural suffix -ya: and the 1st person object 
suffix -ma:) 
(e) Column 10 includes the cislocative suffix -mu, which always occurs towards 
the end of the sequence of derivational suffixes, but never after the benefactive 
suffix -pu when it introduces an extra participant. 
(viii) The reciprocal suffix -na (column 4) must be combined with -ku (column 5) to form 
the reciprocal suffix-naku. While no other suffix occurs in between them, some 
exceptions with the aspect markers -tsi and -yka: are possible (see Section 4.6.2.2.3).  
(ix) In the same verb, -chaku never combines with -ku or -paku; nor does -rku and -yku; 
nor -mu and -ma:. 
 
4.6.3 Inflectional categories of the verb 
HQ verbs inflect for person, number, and tense. Conditionals and imperatives instantiate 
grammatical mood, and they can be considered inflectional in their distribution. Table 4.12 
presents the inflectional paradigms for the basic forms.  
 
<Insert table 4.12 here> 
 
There are also periphrastic verbal constructions used to convey the present perfect (which can 
also use a basic paradigm), the non-experienced or narrative past, the habitual past, and the 
perfect conditional. All of those forms use ka- ‘to be’ as their auxiliary. Table 4.13 presents the 
inflectional paradigms for the periphrastic forms. 
 
<Insert table 4,13 here> 
 
4.6.3.1 Person and number 
A three-person system, plus the distinction between the 1st person inclusive (-ntsik) and 1st 
person exclusive (-ya-ː) is used (see also Section 4.5.1.1.1 on personal pronouns). HQ verbs use -
ya: as their exclusive marker of plurality (the exception being 1st person inclusive -ntsik, itself a 
plural form). Its position aligns it with other derivational suffixes (specifically, it must be placed 
before the cislocative suffix -mu.) Tables 4.12 and 4.13 illustrate the use of the verbal plural 
suffix -ya: with basic and periphrastic paradigms. Some alternations in the position of -ya: occur 
in the habitual past (see Section 4.6.3.2.6). As expected with other derivational suffixes with 
long vowel, it shortens if followed by a consonant coda. 
  
4.6.3.1.1 Subject marking 
As is customary for Central Quechua languages, the 1st person subject is marked through vowel 
lengthening. The 2nd person subject uses -nki, except in the experienced past tense -rqa and one 
of the forms of the past perfect -shqa, where -yki is preferred. The 3rd person subject is marked 
with -n. However, periphrastic forms like non-experienced past, habitual past, and the past 
perfect do not use -n because their 3rd person depends on the unexpressed 3rd person form of ka- 
‘to be,’ their auxiliary. 
 
4.6.3.1.2 Object marking 
As usual in many Quechuan languages, person inflections include a paradigm for object 
marking. The traditionally labeled “transitions” system conveys the interaction between subject 
and object. Thus a verb like kuya- ‘to love’ takes -q to indicate a 1st person subject and a 2nd 
person object: kuya-q ‘I love you.’ Conversely, if a 2nd person targets a 1st  person, -ma: is used 
to indicate the 1st person object, while the basic 2nd person subject marking -nki remains: kuya-
ma-nki ‘You love me’ (-ma: undergoes vowel shortening). If a 3rd person targets a 2nd person, 
then -shu-nki is used: kuya-shu-nki ‘s/he loves you.’ Although -shu-nki appears as a single 
suffix, it is actually divided in two suffixes, one before the tense marker, and the other right after 
it (e.g. kuya-shu-rqa-yki, from kuya- ‘to love’ in past tense -rqa). Also, with non-inflected forms 
like different-subject subordinator -pti and other nominalizers, -shu-yki is used. Finally, a 3rd 
person object is never marked in the verb (zero marking). Thus, if its object referent is implicit, 
the verb is only marked for subject. 
This marking system is irregular. The 1st person object marker -ma: combines with the 
regular person subject markers. However, -q (1st person subject to 2nd person object) and -shu-
nki (3rd person subject to 2nd person object) fulfill the subject and object function and are the 
only person marker allowed. Furthermore, in the future tense -yki is used instead of -q. Finally, in 
order to indicate interaction between plural subjects or objects, only -ya: is used. This produces 
several instances of ambiguity. For instance, kuya-ya:-ma-nki (2nd person subject and 1st person 
object) yields ‘you (PL) love me,’ ‘you love us,’ and ‘you (PL) love us.’ Table 4.14 shows the 
distribution of subject-object person markers including plurals. 
 
<Insert table 4.14 here> 
 
4.6.3.2 Tense 
HQ, like other Quechuan languages, distinguishes between three basic tenses: Present (aywa-n 
‘s/he goes,’), past (aywa-rqa-n ‘s/he went,’) and future (aywa-nqa ‘s/he will go’). This system 
shows a high degree of regularity with little fusion of tense and person. Tense suffixes are used 
first among inflectional suffixes, with the exception of -shu-nki, whose first part immediately 
precedes tense (see Section 4.6.3.1.2). 
 
4.6.3.2.1 Present 
Present tense is zero-marked, and it just needs person agreement added to the stem. Since the 
present is not strictly anchored in a precise time coinciding with the enunciation moment, it is 
frequently used to express an event located in the near past. This is common in narrations, where 
the present is deployed to create a sequence of events. Also, the present can express habitual 
situations such as customary actions or situations that extend through time, as for example in 
(117). 
 
(117)  Tsay tsaka kawan.  
 {tsay  tsaka  kawa-n} 
 DEM bridge  live-3.SBJ 
 ‘That bridge exists.’ (lit. ‘lives’) 
 
4.6.3.2.2 -rqa ‘experienced past (PST)’ 
-rqa refers to an experienced event that is located clearly in a previous moment without 
impinging in the current moment of enunciation. -rqa conveys only tense, not aspect. Thus, its 
interpretation can be that of a perfective or imperfective past based on the context of use. In 
Example (118) uryarqan is best viewed as an imperfective that provides background to the 
events in the narration: 
 
(118)  Tsaypita uryayarqan pagadunam munaq kaqkuna. 
{tsay-pita  urya-ya:-rqa-n  pagadu-na-m   muna-q  ka-q-kuna} 
DEM-ABL  work-PLV-PST-3.SBJ paid-DISC-EVD  want-AG be-AG-PL 
‘After that, only those who wanted worked, but for pay.’ (Context: Changes in contracts 
were enforced, so from that point onwards only those wanting to work were doing it and 
getting paid). 
 
It is characteristic for -rqa to refer to an event whose occurrence is considered certain by the 
speaker (see 6.7.3.2. for the notion of direct knowledge in evidentials). Example (118) above 
refers to the process of road constructions in Huaraz during the early 20th century. 
 
4.6.3.2.3 -rqu ‘recent past/perfective of immediateness (‘REC.PST)’ 
The inflectional suffix -rqu originated from the derivational outwards movement -rqu. It is a 
perfective past tense that points at a past that is close to the moment of enunciation, or that 
impinges upon a current time. It takes the same position as -rqa, with which it never combines 
(e,g, rika-rqu-ntsik ‘we just saw, have seen,’ rika-rqa-ntsik ‘we saw.’) It is often found in 
combination with the non-experienced past -naq, giving it a perfective interpretation (see Section 
6.3.2.4).  
 
4.6.3.2.4 -naq ‘non-experienced past or narrative past (NARR.PST)’ 
-naq indicates that an event belongs to a narration (i.e., is fictional), or it took place with its 
subject not being completely aware of it (e.g., dreams, hallucinations, drunkenness, or early 
childhood.) Like the experienced past -rqa, it is not marked for aspect. To obtain a perfective 
interpretation, -rqu is used before -naq. This is a periphrastic form that requires the auxiliary 
ka- ‘to be’ (e.g. punu-naq ka-: ‘I slept,’ punu-naq ka-nki ‘you slept,’ and punu-naq ‘s/he slept;’ 
see Table 4.13 for the full paradigm). Examples of -naq are in (7), (10), (24), and (50), among 
others. 
4.6.3.2.5 -shqa ‘past perfect (PRF)’ 
The form -shqa is cognate with -sqa, the narrative or non-experienced past present in southern 
and northern varieties (see Chapter 5 by Aviva Shimelman in this volume for Yauyos Quechua). 
The past perfect shows three different patterns in the Ancash region (Parker 1976: 109–10); in 
my HQ corpus shows only two of them are instantiated. The non-periphrastic one combines 
person agreement with the perfect suffix -shqa (e.g. miku-shqa-: ‘I have eaten,’ miku-shqa-nki 
‘you have eaten,’ and miku-shqa ‘s/he has eaten’). The periphrastic pattern is also attested, where 
-shqa co-occurs with the auxiliary ka- ‘to be’ conjugated for subject person (e.g. miku-shqa ka-: 
‘I have eaten,’ muku-shqa ka-nki ‘you have eaten,’ and miku-shqa ‘s/he has eaten’). The past 
perfect has been considered as quite similar in meaning to the recent past -rqu (Parker 1976: 109; 
Julca Guerrero 2009a: 207). My analysis is that this is a perfective past that does not make any 
assumptions about its proximity to a current situation. However, affectedness of the subject 
seems to be relevant up to what is the current time of enunciation, as Examples (119) and (120) 
show. 
 
(119)  Tayta:, maychawtaq tarishqa kanki? 
{tayta-ː  may-chaw-taq   tari-shqa  ka-nki} 
father-1.POSS where-LOC-CONTR find-PRF be-2.SBJ 
‘Sir, where have you found it?’ (Context: The speaker is impressed with the beautiful 
horse a stranger has arrived with.) 
 
(120)  Llapan yachaynikiwanmi limpu trampaman ishkishqa kanki. 
{llapa-n  yacha-y-ni-yki-wan-mi   
all-3.POSS know-INF-EP-2.POSS-COM-EVD  
limpu  trampa-man  ishki-shqa  ka-nki} 
fully trap-ALL fall-PRF be-2.SBJ  
‘With all your knowledge, you have completely fallen into the trap.’  
 
4.6.3.2.6 -q + kay ‘habitual past construction (HAB)’ 
A habitual event in the past can be expressed with a periphrastic construction involving the 
agentive nominalizer -q with the main verb, and the copulative verb ka- ‘to be’ in the present 
tense and marked for subject (e.g. kuya-q ka-: ‘I used to love,’ kuya-q ka-nki ‘you used to love,’ 
kuya-q ‘s/he used to love;’ see Table 4.13 for the full paradigm.)  
The use of the verbal plural marker -ya: in the habitual past construction shows dialectal 
variation, and my corpus reflects this. Some speakers use the plural marker with the main verb, 
before -q, others with the auxiliary ka-, while still others use it with both. Sometimes, even the 
same source shows those three distributions. For instance, ‘we (EXCL) used to play’ can be 
expressed as puklla-ya-q ka:, pukllaq ka-ya-:, or puklla-ya-q ka-ya-:. 
Regarding the use of subject-object marking, they go with the main verb (e.g. kuya-ma-q 
ka-nki ‘you used to love me,’ kuya-shu-q ka-nki ‘s/he used to love you,’ kuya-ma-q ka-ntsik 
‘s/he/they used to love us (INCL)’). Due to the coincidence between the nominalizer -q and the 
1st person subject and 2nd person object marker -q, only an accusative-marked overt pronoun 
marked accusative (e.g., qam-ta kuya-q ka-: ‘I used to love you’). 
 
4.6.3.2.7 ‘future (FUT)’ 
The future is the only irregular tense in HQ (see Table 4.12). The 2nd person is the same as the 
one in the present tense. Each other person has their own future marker (1st person -shaq, 1st 
person inclusive -shun, 3rd person -nqa), which makes the future a case of fusional morphology. 
See Table 4.12 for its full paradigm. The 1st person future suffix -shaq alternates with -shqa and 
with -sha when combined with the irregular 1st subject to 2nd object marker -yki (e.g., 
maqa-shqa-yki or maqa-sha-yki, ‘I will hit you’). 
 
4.6.3.3 ‘conditionals (COND)’ 
This irrealis mood category is translated through the auxiliaries would and could in English, as in 
Example (121).They express situations considered less likely than those marked with future 
tense. 
 
(121)  Puklla:man paywan. 
{puklla -ː-man   pay-wan 
play-1.SBJ-COND  s/he-COM 
‘I would/could play with her.’ 
 
While its formation follows a regular pattern, this inflectional category comes from the 
regularization of a periphrastic pattern. Arguably, the illative case -man became the conditional 
marker. As such, it follows the normal person markers (1st person -ː, 2nd person -nki, 1st person 
inclusive -ntsik, and 3rd person -n). See Table 4.12 for the full conditional paradigm. In my 
corpus the 1st person inclusive is expressed only through the fusional form -shwan (e.g. puwidi-
shwan ‘we would be able to,’ from puwidi- ‘to be able to’). 
 The perfective aspect is marked in the conditional by means of the invariably auxiliary 
karqan (i.e. ka- ‘to be’ in the 3rd person singular.) Thus, forms like miku-u-man ka-rqa-n ‘I 
would have eaten,’ miku-nki-man ka-rqa-n ‘you would have eaten,’ and miku-n-man ka-rqa-n 
‘s/he would have eaten’ are used (see Table 4.13 for the full paradigm).  
 Regarding subject-object person markers, they take the place of the subject person 
markers (e.g. parla- ‘to talk’ produces parla-ma-n-man, ‘s/he would talk to me,’ parla-ya-q-
man ‘I would talk to you (PL),’ ‘we would talk to you,’ ‘we would talk to you (PL),’ and parla-
shu-nki-man ‘s/he would talk to you.’) 
  
4.6.3.4 ‘imperatives (IMP)’ 
Imperative mood is marked for the 2nd person with the suffix -y, the 1st person plural inclusive 
with the suffix -shun (which is the corresponding future form), and for the 3rd person 
(injunctive) with the suffix -tsun, Plural forms are created with -ya:, which is placed before the 
imperative suffix. The full paradigm is available in Table 4.12. Examples of imperatives are in 
(55), (77), and (84), among others. HQ has a prohibitive construction combining the imperative 
suffixes with the particle ama, ‘do not,’ which requires the use of the negative suffix -tsu. It is 
illustrated in Example (122). 
 
(122)  Ama parlayaytsu! 
{ama  parla-ya-y-tsu} 
PROH speak-PLV-IMP-NEG 
‘Don’t you (PL) speak!’ 
 
4.7 Independent suffixes (enclitics) 
As in all Quechuan languages, HQ uses independent suffixes (or “enclitics” in traditional 
grammatical description). They can attach to nouns, verbs, or particles. Enclitics come after 
nominal or verbal inflectional suffixes. I follow Parker’s (1976: 145-149) three-way organization 
of independent suffixes based on their distribution. The first group includes those that connect 
the information in the sentence where they are placed to information in another sentence or 
considered implicit. These include the continuative -raq, the discontinuative -na, the 
additive -pis, and the contrastive -taq. The second group features suffixes that provide a negative 
or interrogative focus to any part of the sentence. These include the negative -tsu and the 
interrogative -ku. The final group includes those suffixes conveying the stance a speaker has 
regarding the statement produced and whether that information is old or new. This group 
includes the topic -qa, and the evidentials -mi ~ -m, -shi ~-sh, -chi, -cha:, and -ri.) Enclitics can 
be used only once per sentence; however some exceptions can be found. 
 
4.7.1 Connectors of sentence information 
4.7.1.1 -raq ‘continuative (CONT)’ 
-raq conveys the notion of continuity. As such, it is commonly translated as ‘yet’ or ‘still,’ as in 
Example (123). 
 
(123)  Punuykanraq.  
{punu-yka:-n-raq} 
sleep-IPFV-3.SBJ-CONT 
‘She is still sleeping.’ 
 
However, this suffix is best understood in relation with some previous condition or assumption 
in spite of which something (an event or a nominal) is brought into the current focus of attention. 
Punuykanraq implies that sleeping time should be over, and manaraq, that something should be 
the case already, but it is not yet. This type of contrastive notion associated with -raq yields the 
idea of priority or even recentness, as illustrated in Example (124). 
 
(124)  Na:nitaraq ruramuy.  
{na:ni-ta-raq   rura-mu-y} 
road-ACC-CONT make-CISL-IMP  
‘Make the road first.’ 
 
In this example, the scope of the continuative is not on the action rura- ‘to make,’ but on the 
object nominal. What the speaker has in mind, here na: ‘road,’ takes precedence over anything 
else, thus the meaning intended is that of ‘first the road.’ Likewise, tsay-raq (from tsay ‘that’) is 
best understood as an adverbial modifier meaning ‘recently, just,’ or even ‘at last.’ In Section 
4.5.1.1.4, we saw that -raq combines with interrogative pronouns. A form like ima-paq-raq 
‘what for?’ (from ima ‘what’ and dative -paq) implies that some previous condition should not 
be expected to hold at the moment of the question, thus the uncertainty or rhetorical quality with 
which it has been described (Parker 1976: 146; Julca Guerrero 2009a: 260). 
 
4.7.1.2 -na ‘discontinuative (DISC)’ 
This enclitic can be considered as having the opposite meaning as -raq. It conveys the idea of 
discontinuity: an assumption of continuity is contradicted by the term marked with -na. In other 
words, whatever is marked with -na stands in sharp contrast with information previously 
assumed or mentioned. Common translations are ‘already, anymore, now’ (e.g. paqas-na 
‘already night,’ from paqas ‘night,’ mana-na ‘not anymore,’ from mana ‘no’). Another example 
is in (125). 
 
(125) Sha:rikuyna.  
 {sha:ri-ku-y-na} 
 get.up-MID-IMP-DISC 
 ‘Get up now!’ 
 
-na is also used frequently with nominals. Arguably, in those cases the referent of the noun 
marked with -na is a new instance in a sequence and it contrasts with whatever or whoever took 
place before. This seems to be the case in tsay-na ‘therefore’ (from tsay ‘that’). In Example 
(126), different animals are making noises together in order to scare some people. The first 
instance, ashnu ‘donkey,’ is unmarked. Then, every animal making a noise is marked with -na.  
 
(126)  Ashnu llapan kallpanwan ha:chinyarqan. Allquna anirqan… Mishina ñawyarqan. 
Galluna kantarqan. 
 {ashnu  llapa-n  kallpa-n-wan   ha:chinya-rqa-n  
 donkey  all-3.POSS force-3.POSS-COM bray-PST-3.SBJ 
allqu-na  ani-rqa-n mishi-na  ñawya-rqa-n  
dog-DISC bark-PST-3.SBJ cat-DISC meow-PST-3.SBJ 
gallu-na  kanta-rqa-n} 
 rooster-DISC sing-PST-3.SBJ 
‘The donkey brayed with all his strength. And the dog barked… And the cat meowed. 
And the rooster sang.’ 
 
4.7.1.3 -pis ‘additive (ADD)’ 
The function of this suffix is to indicate that a term is also the case or also present alongside 
other information in the sentence (e.g. ruripa-n-pis ‘also her skirt,’ from ruripa ‘skirt,’ kanan-pis 
‘also now,’ from kanan ‘now;’ qatsawa-n-pis ‘he also dances,’ from qatswa- ‘to dance’ in the 
3rd person -n.) However, this notion of addition is not restricted to objectively adding a new 
referent or notion. Instead, it can be used with the sense of something that gets added despite of a 
previous notion. Thus, the previous examples could also be translated as ‘although’ or ‘even’ 
(Example 91 clearly shows this function of -pis.) For the use of -pis with interrogative pronouns 
to create indefinite pronouns, see Section 6.5.1.1.4. 
 
4.7.1.4  -taq ‘contrastive (CONTR)’ 
This suffix conveys the idea that some information in the sentence contradicts previous 
information. In other words, -taq adds new information whose function is to be in contrast with 
some old information. -taq never appears with the topic marker -qa in the same word, since the 
latter links a term with current relevance to co-referential old information. The contrastive use of 
-taq is clearly illustrated in Example (115) above. In the narration, a fox says Alla:pa-taq kayqa 
nanaykun, ¡ananáw! ‘This hurts a lot, ouch!’ Alla:pa ‘a lot’ is marked with -taq because the fox 
was not expecting the process to be painful.  
The contrastive enclitic is frequently associated with interrogative pronouns as a way to 
link the question to previous information. -taq attaches to the head of the interrogative phrase, as 
in the Examples in (127) and (128). 
 
(127) Imataq tsay? 
 {ima-taq  tsay} 
 what-CONTR DEM 
 ‘What is that?’ 
 
(128) Ima ninataq tsayqa? 
 {ima  ni-na-taq   tsay-qa} 
 what say-POT.NMLZ-CONTR DEM-TOP 
 ‘What does that mean?’ 
 
The accusative suffix -ta can be omitted when -taq is used (Ima-ta-taq / Ima-taq rura-nki? ‘What 
do you do?,’ with rura- ‘to do, make’ marked for 2nd person -nki.) 
 Finally, there is alternation between -taq and -tan. The latter is preferred in the Northern 
Huaylas variety (Julca Guerrero 2009a: 260). Parker (1976: 147) argues that they are not exactly 
interchangeable because -taq has more contexts of use. I have not observed enough instances of -
tan to determine what could differentiate it from -taq.  
  
4.7.2 Negative and interrogative  
 
4.7.2.1 -tsu ‘negative (NEG)’ 
This suffix makes any word the focus of a negation (e.g. alli-tsu ‘not good,’ from alli ‘good,’ 
alla:pa-raq-tsu ‘not much yet,’ from alla:pa ‘much’ and continuative -raq.) The negated term 
with -tsu can be introduced by a negator like mana ‘no’ or the prohibitive ama ‘do not,’ but only 
the second is mandatory. -tsu can combine in the same word with enclitics in the first group, with 
the exception of -taq. However, it seems that it never combines in the same word with enclitics 
in the third group (topic and evidentials), but more analysis is required. See Section 6.8.3.2 for 
examples and information on the use of -tsu in negative sentences.  
 
4.7.2.2 -ku ‘interrogative (Q)’ 
-ku is added to any word to make it the focus of a question whose answer can only be awmi ‘yes’ 
or mana ‘no.’ For instance, the question in Example (129) is asking whether that is your destination 
or not by marking the goal with -ku. 
 
(129) Tsaymanku aywanki? 
 {tsay-man-ku  aywa-nki} 
 DEM-ALL-Q go-2.SBJ 
 ‘Do you go there?’ 
 
On the other hand, Example (130) focuses on whether you live or not at a place (ta:- ‘to live’ with 
middle -ku in the 2nd person -nki and tsay ‘that’ with locative -chaw.) 
 
(130) Tsaychaw ta:kunkiku?  
 {tsay-chaw  ta:-ku-nki-ku?} 
 DEM-LOC live-MID-2.SBJ-Q 
‘Do you live there?’ 
 
When the negator mana ‘no’ takes -ku the resultin g expression is a negative question , as 
exemplified in (131). 
 
(131) Manaku munanki? 
 {mana-ku  muna-nki} 
 NEG-Q  want-2.SBJ 
‘Don’t you want (it)?’26  
 
4.7.3 Modality: topic and evidentials 
 
4.7.3.1 -qa ‘topic (TOP)’ 
The main function of the topic marker -qa is to keep track of whatever has been mentioned 
before in the discourse, and that is brought back to the attention of the addressee. Thus, the 
function of marking old, known, or active information suits most uses of -qa. In Example (132) -
qa marks takla:qa ‘my footplow,’ which refers to the previously mentioned term takllallata ‘a 
foot plow’ (old information). 
 
(132)  ¿Manaku takllallata rikarqunki?, ¡takllalla:qa manataq kantsu! 
{mana-ku  taklla-lla-ta   rika-rqu-nki   taklla-lla-ː-qa    
no-Q  foot.plow-LIM-ACC see-REC.PST-2.SBJ foot.plow-1.POSS-TOP  
mana-taq  ka-n-tsu} 
no-CONTR be-3.SBJ-NEG 
 ‘Haven’t you seen a foot plow? My foot plow is not there!’ 
 
Although the topic marker can appear with any word class, most of the times nominals are 
marked. Very few instances are inflected verbs (unless they are nominalized). Subordinate 
constructions with -pti or -r (see Sections 4.8.4.2.3.1 and 4.8.4.2.3.3), and particles like itsan 
‘instead’ or kanan ‘now’ are also frequently combined with -qa, and they take more specific 
meanings, arguably contrastive (itsan-qa ‘however,’ and kanan-qa ‘right now.’) In my corpus -
qa is mostly used once per sentence (considered in terms of the presence of a main inflected 
verb). However, some exceptions exist. In Example (133), each instance marked with -qa stands 
in clear contrast to the way in which the person addressed by the speaker was cultivating

26 The negator -ku has no relation with middle voice -ku. They are homonyms.  
  
Perhaps this contrastive function of -qa is related to bringing the attention of the hearer to 
something the subject considers important to elaborate upon. This is essentially the function of 
marking some information as the topic about which some comments are offered. In any case, it 
should be noticed that -qa does not combine with -raq, -na, or -taq in the same word. 
 
4.7.3.2 -mi ‘evidential – direct experience (EVD)’ 
While -qa provides the topic or currently considered piece of information in a text, evidentials 
convey the information the speaker considers most relevant in order to comment upon the 
provided topic. In HQ, as in all Quechuan languages, the comment information is marked based 
on levels of certitude the speaker assigns to that information. The first evidential is -mi (-m after 
a short vowel). It indicates that the information offered comes from the speaker’s direct 
experience. By using it, the speaker presents themselves as a worthy source, a witness, or 
confident enough to vouch for the information. Frequently, it marks the information that answers 
a question, as in Example (134). 
 
(134)  Pitaq tsay shipash? —Payqa churi:mi. 
 {pi-taq  tsay  shipash  pay-qa   churi-ː-mi} 
 who-CONTR DEM young.woman she-TOP child-1.POSS-EVD 
‘Who is that young woman? —She is my daughter.’ 
  
As with any enclitic, -mi is placed in any word the speaker marks as the comment. Thus, a 
sentence like Leonel tsay-man away-n ‘Leonel goes there’ could place the direct evidential on 
each word. Leonel-mi would stress that it is Leonel who goes there; tsay-man-mi, that it is there 
that Leonel goes. If placed on the verb, the whole sentence is considered the scope of the 
evidential (Julca Guerrero 2009a: 252). Other examples with -mi are in (1) and (120).  
 
4.7.3.3 -shi ‘evidential – reportative/quotative (EVR)’ 
-shi (-sh after a short vowel) indicates that the information provided comes not from direct 
experience of the speaker, but from someone else’s testimony or report, hence the term 
“reportative” or “quotative evidential.” This source is a 3rd person who does not directly 
participate in the speech act. Like -mi, it is possible to place -shi on any word in a sentence, but 
only once. This evidential marker is closely associated with the meaning of -naq, the non-
experienced past tense. In few cases, they are used together to emphasize the non-experienced 
nature of what is narrated, as Example (135) below illustrates. 
(135)  Achikaypapis kapunaqshi huk warmi wamran. 
{achikay-pa-pis  ka-pu-naq-shi  huk  warmi  wamra-n} 
achique-GEN-ADD be-BEN-NARR.PST-EVR one female  child-3.POSS 
‘They say that Achiqué had a daughter.’ 
 
Some degree of uncertainty is associated with -shi. Therefore, it can be used with interrogative 
pronouns to suggest perplexity from the person asking the question (e.g., in Example 99 imanir-
taq-shi ‘why could it be?’) Examples of -shi in narrations (i.e. non-witnessed events) are found 
in (94) and (99). Uses of the indirect evidential -shi with tsay functioning as a connective of 
consequence (‘therefore, they say’) can be found in Examples (29) and (53). 
 
4.7.3.4 -chi ‘evidential – conjectural (EVC)’  
-chi conveys an attitude the speaker has towards the source of the information that is being 
presented. In this case, the information comes from a conjecture. This means that there is some 
degree of certainty associated with what is said, although not a complete one. Example (112) 
provided a use of -chi in upu-paku-ri-shaq-chi ‘it seems like I am going to drink a lot’ to express 
something that the speaker believed possible. Example (136) offers a case of likely conjecture:  
 
(136)  Tsuri:taqa alla:pachi ankushaq. 
{tsuri-ː-ta-qa   alla:pa-chi  anku-shaq} 
child-1.POSS-ACC-TOP much-EVC miss-1.SBJ.FUT 
‘I will miss my daughter surely a lot.’ 
 
When used with an interrogative pronoun, -chi indicates that there is no complete certainty about 
what is being asked. The person asking is unsure about what they ask or think that there is no 
answer to the question (ima-chi? ‘what could it be?’) 
Finally, the conjectural evidential -chi can be followed by -ya:, an emphatic suffix 
increasing the certainty of the information. This use is barely present in my corpus, but Julca 
Guerrero (2009a, 2010) registers its use in the Huaraz province, see Example (137). 
 
(137)  Allquykichiya: wamralla:ta kanishqa. 
allqu-yki-chi-ya:  wamra-lla:-ta  kani-shqa.  
dog-2.POSS-CONJ-EMPH  child-DIM-ACC  bit-3.SBJ.PERF 
‘It is quite likely that your dog has bitten my child.’  
    (adapted from Julca Guerrero 2009a: 256) 
 
4.7.3.5 -ri ‘corroborative (CORR)’ 
This enclitic is not an evidential like -mi, -shi, or -chi, since it does not relate to the quality or 
validity of the information. Instead, it conveys the idea that the speaker is in agreement with 
some information the interlocutor has presented, as illustrated in Example (138). 
 
(138)  —Aywankiku? —Aywashaqri! 
{aywa-nki-ku  aywa-shaq-ri} 
go-2.SBJ-Q go-1SBJ.FUT-CORR 
‘Are you going? -I will go, of course!’ 
 
As in Example (139), -ri can also imply that the addressee should agree with what the speaker 
thinks addressee. 
 
(139)  Amari pinqakuytsu, qichwa shimintsikta parlakushun. 
{ama-ri  pinqa-ku-y-tsu  qichwa   
PROH-CORR shame-MID-IMP-NEG quechua  
shimi-ntsik-ta    parla-ku-shun} 
language-1.INCL.POSS-ACC speak-MID-1.PL.INCL.SBJ.FUT 
‘Do not feel embarrassed, let’s speak our Quechua language.’ (Implicit: There is nothing 
to be embarrassed about speaking Quechua) 
 
In a way, -ri also indicates that something is the current focus of attention. As such, it doesn’t 
seem to combine with -qa, but it combines with the evidentials (e.g. tsay-mi-ri ‘therefore, of 
course’ from tsay ‘that’ or wawa-yki-sh-ri ‘they say that your child, of course, from wawa-yki 
‘your child’). 
 
4.7.3.6 -tsuraq ‘dubitative (DUB)’ 
The combination of interrogative -tsu and the continuative -raq can be considered a fused 
element -tsuraq. This suffix is used for yes/no questions. However, what the question implies is 
considered unlikely (e.g. ka-n-tsuraq? ‘could there be?,’ from ka-n ‘there is,’ or  qam-tsuraq? 
‘perhaps it is you?,’ from qam ‘you’). 
 
4.8 Basic syntax 
 
4.8.1 Grammatical relations 
Like every Quechuan language, HQ can be considered a typical instance of nominative-
accusative alignment. The A (agent-like subject) argument of a transitive verb and the S (single 
argument) of an intransitive verb are marked equally in the zero-marked nominative case. The P 
(patient-like) argument receives the accusative case suffix -ta. Examples (140) illustrates the 
pattern with an intransitive sentence, while (141) presents a transitive one.  
 
(140)  Malli puriykan. 
{malli-ø puri-yka:-n} 
María-NOM walk-IPFV-3.SBJ 
‘María is walking.’ 
 
(141)  Malli hakata aruykan. 
{malli haka-ta  aru-yka:-n} 
María guinea.pig-ACC cook-IPFV-3.SBJ 
‘María is cooking a guinea pig.’ 
 
4.8.2 Constituent order 
HQ places the modifier before the head. This is clearly illustrated in Section 4.5.1.4 through the 
order of constituents in the nominal phrase, where the nominal head is preceded by different 
types of modifiers (e.g., demonstratives, numerals, property terms, or adjectives.) This ordering 
takes place also with the genitive possessor preceding the possessed nominal, which is marked 
with a nominal possessive suffix (see Sections 4.5.3.1 and 4.5.3.3.2). Relative clauses (formed 
with nominalizers like -q, -shqa, -nqa, and -na) also precede the modified head (however, 
appositional modifiers are always found after the head, see Section 4.8.4.2.1.2).  Likewise, 
adverbs (as well as so-called pre-adjectives) precede their head (see Section 4.5.1).  
The unmarked constituent order is SOV. Most examples including accusative-marked 
arguments illustrate this (see Examples (1) and (12) to mention only the first ones with SOV 
order). However, it is not uncommon for the object to appear after the verb. This can be seen in 
Examples (29), (65) and (90). No instances of OSV have been found in my corpus. As it seems 
to be the norm for Quechuan languages, subordinate clauses (nominalized or using same-subject 
-r or different subject -pti) are much stricter regarding OV order. Examples (7) and (91) illustrate 
this.  
 
4.8.3 Major clause types 
4.8.3.1 Assertions 
Regarding assertions, also known as declarative clauses, Sections 4.7.1 and 4.7.3 offer several 
examples of how they are expressed through enclitics like the continuative -raq, the 
discontinuative -na, the contrastive -taq, the topic -qa, evidentials, and emphatic markers. While 
those enclitics are by no means mandatory to express an assertion, they are frequenly associated 
with maintaining the flow of information. Also, HQ speakers, as is common in other Quechuan 
languages, tend to perceive the lack of enclitics as something that weakens the clarity of what is 
being said. 
  
4.8.3.2 Negations and prohibitions 
Negative clauses are formed by using the enclitic -tsu (see Section 4.7.2.1). This suffix can mark 
any term in a sentence with a negative focus; however, if -tsu is on an inflected verb, then the 
scope of the negation will be the whole sentence. Examples in (142) – (145) illustrate the 
different words or phrases to which -tsu can attach. 
 
(142)  Tsayshi mana allitsu kanqa. 
{tsay-shi  mana  alli-tsu  ka-nqa} 
DEM-EVR no good-NEG be-3.SBJ.FUT 
‘Therefore, they say, it will be no good.’ 
 
(143)  Kikinkuna pura mana akwirdutsu kayarqan. 
{kiki-n-kuna pura  mana  akwirdu-tsu   ka-ya-rqa-n} 
self-3.POSS-PL EXCL no agreement-NEG be-PLV-PST-3.SBJ 
‘They were in no agreement among themselves.’ 
 
(144)  Mana allita rurarqantsu. 
{mana  alli-ta   rura-rqa-n-tsu} 
No good-ACC make-PST-3.SBJ-NEG 
‘She didn’t do it well.’ 
 
(145)  Rukusqa kakashta mana willashqatsu. 
{rukus-qa   kakash-ta  mana willa-shqa-tsu} 
sparrow.hawk-TOP rooster-ACC no tell-3.SBJ.PRF-NEG 
‘The sparrow-hawk has not told it to the rooster.’ 
 
-tsu is used only within a sentence (i.e. a clause with an inflected verb.) Mana ‘no’ becomes the 
mandatory negative operator outside of the sentence level (e.g. alli ‘good’ > mana alli ‘bad, no 
good.’). The absence of -tsu and the need for mana ‘no’ can be seen in Example (146) with a 
nominalized purpose subordinate (on which see Section 4.8.4.2.3.4): 
 
(146)  Mana atuq rika:ma:nanpaq punchuykillawan tsapaykamay. 
{mana atuq  rika:-ma:-na-n-paq  
no fox see-1.OBJ-POT.NMLZ-3.POSS-DAT 
punchu-yki-lla-wan   tsapa-yku-ma:-y} 
poncho-2.POSS-LIM-COM cover-EXCEP-1.OBJ-IMP 
 ‘Cover me with your poncho please, so that the fox doesn’t see me.’ 
 
Despite the frequent use of mana in agreement with -tsu, it is common to find sentences in which 
only -tsu is used (e.g. musya-:-tsu ‘I don’t know,’ from musya- ‘to know’) Optionality in the use 
of mana can be considered as part of a diachronic cycle (Pineda-Bernuy 2014) in which 
languages with one negative marker (e.g. mana ‘no’) develop a negative agreement (e.g. mana + 
-tsu), and then reduce to a single marker (only -tsu.) According to Villari’s (2017: 70) study of 
negation in the Huaraz province, a plausible synchronic motivation for the absence of mana ‘no’ 
before -tsu could be the presence of that negator or ni ‘nor’ (see Section 8.5.1.1.4) in the 
previous co-text.  
HQ uses the negative particle ama ‘do not’ as a prohibitive. This is observed with all the 
imperative forms, which must be negated with -tsu. See Section 4.6.3.4 and Examples (49), 
(122), and (139) for the use of ama. 
 
4.8.3.4 Questions 
Interrogative sentences have been presented in Sections 4.5.1.1.4 on interrogative pronouns and 
Section 4.7.2.2  on the interrogative enclitic -ku for yes/no questions.  
HQ, like several other Quechuan languages, has an interrogative verb, imana- ‘to happen; 
to do.’ It is used to ask about an indefinite action. As such, it can be used as an intransitive verb 
meaning ‘what’s going on?’, as in Example (147). 
 
(147)  Imanaykan?  
 {imana-yka-n} 
 happen-CONT-3.SBJ 
 ‘What’s going on?’ 
 
However, it also works with an overt or implied direct object, as in the Examples (148) and (149) 
 
(148)  Nuqa imana:taq payta? 
 {nuqa  imana-:-taq   pay-ta} 
 I happen-1.SBJ-CONTR s/he-ACC 
 ‘What do I do to her?’ 
 
(149) Imanankitaq? 
 {imana-nki-taq} 
 do-2.SBJ.FUT-CONTR 
 ‘What will you do?’  
 
This question does not ask about a concrete thing that the addressee will do. Instead, it refers to a 
whole action as a response to some issue. This is analogous to the role of the direct object as 
stimulus (see Section 4.6.1.2), which makes imana- a type of semantically intransitive verb (see 
Section 4.6.1.3.)  
Subject-object agreement marking is also possible with imana-, see Example (150). 
 
(150) Imanashunkitaq? 
 {imana-shu-nki-taq} 
happen-3.SBJ-2.OBJ-CONTR 
‘What’s the matter with you?,’ ‘Does it affect you?’  
 
 
A common expression of resignation in front of adversity, in Example (151), uses imana in the 
1st person inclusive 
 
(151) Imanashun? 
 {imana-shun}  
do-1PL.INCL.SBJ.FUT 
‘What could be done?’ (lit. What will we do? What will happen to us?) 
 
4.8.4 Complex clauses 
Complex clauses include more than one verbal head. They can be formed through juxtaposition 
(the direct combination of two or more sentences), coordination (the assembly of clauses through 
a connecting suffix or particle), and subordination (the use of a verbal clause to fulfill the 
grammatical functions of modifiers or arguments within a sentence). 
 
4.8.4.1 Juxtaposition and coordination 
Juxtaposition is the process of connecting two or more sentences without using any overt 
grammatical marker for this. Clauses are presented sequentially based on their semantic 
compatibility. In Example (152), two sentences with inflected verbs hiqakurqunaq ‘he fell’ and 
rikayka:naq ‘he saw’ are juxtaposed, with the second sentence being the cause of the first: 
 
(152)  Hiqakurqunaq huk fiyu sanhaman, mana allinta rikayka:naq. 
 {hiqa-ku-rqu-naq   huk  fiyu  sanha-man  
 fall-MID-REC.PST-NARR.PST one ugly ditch-ALL  
mana  allin-ta  rika:-yka:-naq} 
no good-ACC see-IPFV-NARR.PST 
‘He fell into an awfully deep ditch; he wasn’t seeing well.’ 
 
Coordinated clauses in HQ that explicitly connect different information are traditionally called 
“conjunctive coordinate sentences.” They are obtained through enclitics like the continuative -
raq, the discontinuative -na, the additive -pis, and the contrastive -taq. As seen in Section 4.7.1, 
they connect the information they mark to other implicit or overt information in a previous 
sentence. A true coordinating function for those enclitics was exemplified for -na in Example 
(126). A similar type of distribution can be obtained through the use of -raq. This is best used 
with the same subject performing different actions simultaneously: qotsu-:-raq, wichya-:-raq, 
tushu-:-raq ‘I sing, whistle, and dance at the same time,’ from qotsu- ‘to sing,’ wichya- ‘to 
whistle,’ and tushu- ‘to dance,’ all in the 1st person subject (Julca Guerrero 2009a: 317). In (153) 
and (154), I offer two examples with -taq, the most frequently used coordinating enclitic. 
 
(153)  ¡Añañáw! ¡Achalláw! ¡Kayqa wallqataq! ¡Kayqa rusaryutaq! 
 {añañáw  achalláw  kay-qa    
 sweet  nice  DEM.PROX-TOP  
wallqa-taq   kay-qa   rusaryu-taq}  
necklace-CONTR DEM.PROX-TOP rosary-CONTR 
 ‘Sweet! Nice! This is a necklace! And this a rosary!’ 
 
(154)  Piru tsaychawtaq nuqaqa ka:. Apamurqa:taq mikuyniyki. 
 {piru  tsay-chaw-taq  nuqa-qa  ka-ː

 carry-CISL-PST-1.SBJ-CONTR eat-INF-EP-2.POSS 
 ‘But I was there, and I brought you your food.’ 
  
In HQ the use of coordinating conjunctions from Spanish is widespread. Thus, i (from y ‘and’), 
piru/pero (from pero ‘but’), u/o (from o ‘or’), and purki/porke (from porque ‘because’), among 
others are found throughout the corpus, many times combined with the original HQ connecting 
enclitics. An example of disjunctive coordination using o is in (155). 
 
(155) Itsa kawan o wanushqa? 
{itsa kawa-n   o  wanu-shqa} 
Perhaps live-3.SBJ or die- 3.SBJ.PRF 
‘Maybe they live or maybe they have died?’ 
 
Disjunctive expressions in HQ are viewed as closely related to adversative ones. Itsa is a 
connective that alternates with the Spanish loan pero as in Example (156) (see Section 4.7.3.1 
about itsanqa ‘however’): 
 
(156)  Qamqa allilla kaykay; itsa nuqaqa hutsaykiraykurmi nakamushaqraq. 
{qam-qa  alli-lla   ka-yka:-y  itsa  nuqa-qa

hutsa-yki-raykur-mi  naka-mu-shaq-raq} 
sin-2.POSS-CISL-EVD suffer-CISL-1SBJ.FUT-CONT 
 ‘You stay calm; but I will suffer longer due to your sins.’ 
 
4.8.4.2 Subordination 
Subordination is obtained, like in most Quechuan languages, through the use of nominalized 
forms. They create relative, complement, or adverbial clauses. Still, the main function of 
nominalizers is to turn verbal stems into nominal referents, be they lexical (i.e. an entity) or 
grammatical (i.e. an argument or an event). The infinitive -y, the agentive -q, the resultative 
nominalizer -shqa, the potential nominalizer -na, and the less frequently used actual nominalizer 
(realis) -nqa are the HQ nominalizers (see Section 4.4.2.1). Although they share formal 
properties with nominalizers, the suffixes -pti, -r, and -shpa, discussed in Section 4.8.4.2.3.1, are 
not considered part of that category, but as “subordinating inflections” introducing adverbial 
clauses. 
4.8.4.2.1 Relative clauses 
The first type of subordinate clauses are relative or adjective clauses. They can use any 
nominalizer to create a clause that specifies the referent of the noun they modify, or that can be 
used as an apposition to explain or elaborate upon that referent. There are no restrictions 
regarding the grammatical function of the relativized constituent. This means that the co-referent 
in the relative clause can be a subject, object, or an oblique. 
 
4.8.4.2.1.1 Specifying or restrictive relative clauses 
Example (157) illustrate how nominalizers can be used to restrict the referent of the nominal 
head they modify. First, I will show that the infinitive can be used to create a nominal that can 
modify another one. These are not usually presented as relative clauses, but they are not formally 
different from those created with other nominalizers: 
 
(157)  Wayipita yarquyniyki kanan hunaqmi. 
{wayi-pita  yarqu-y-ni-yki  hunaq-mi  kanan} 
house-ABL exit-INF-EP-2.POSS day-EVD now 
‘The day of your departure from the house is today.’ 
 
Examples (158) – (161) illustrate relative clauses with the remaining nominalizers. It should be 
noticed that -na is only seldom used with this function:27  
 
(158)  …kakashyuq nunaqa alla:pa qishyaq nunata rika:rinaq… 
{kakash-yuq   nuna-qa alla:pa qishya-q  nuna-ta  rika:-ri-naq}

tayta-ː   ranti-ku-shqa-na} 
father-1.POSS trade-MID-3.SBJ.PRF-DISC 
‘My father has already sold the house I was born (in).’ 
   
In (158), (159), and (160) nominal agreement indicates the subject argument of the relative 
clause. If the subject has to be overt, it will be marked with genitive -pa, as in Example (162). 
 
 
27 Weber (1983: 27–31) discusses that Huallaga Quechua differs from Ancash Quechua varieties in that the former 
cannot use nominalizations with -na as adjective clauses. 
(162) qampa mikushqayki papa  
 {qam-pa  miku-shqa-yki  papa} 
 you-GEN eat-RES-2.POSS  potato 
‘the potato you ate’  
 
However, with the agentive nominalizer -q, nominal agreement indicates the object argument, as 
in Example (163). 
 
(163)  kuyaqniyki  
 {kuya-q-ni-yki} 
 love-AG-EP-2.POSS 
 
Other examples of nominalizers as relative clauses are found with -q in (119), and with -shqa in 
(64) and (115). 
Finally, internally headed relative clauses are frequent in HQ with all the nominalizers, 
except the infinitive -y. Example (164) shows a nominalized sentence with no overt modified 
nominal present. It is obvious, however, that this nominal must be wamra ‘child,’ the subject of 
the nominalized clause with -q. 
 
(164)  Hurqurkaraya:mun nunakunata, warmikunata, wamra aywakuykaqta. 
 {hurqu-rku-ri-ya:-mu-n   nuna-kuna-ta  warmi-kuna-ta

wamra  aywa-ku-yka:-q-ta  
child  go-MID-IPFV-AG-ACC 
‘They took out men, women, and the children that were going (to that school).’ 
  
4.8.4.2.1.2 Appositional relative clauses 
The use of nominalized clauses after a nominal head to provide extra information about that head 
is common in HQ. Those appositional relative clauses should be considered as autonomous 
nominals sharing the same referent of the previously mentioned nominal they describe. 
Appositions must share the same case marker as their co-referential head. Example (165) shows 
the use of an apposition with -q introduced through a perception event: 
 
(165)  Manam rikarqu:tsu ni pita kaypa pasaqta. 
{Mana-m rika-rqu-ː-tsu   ni  pi-ta    
no-EVD  see-REC.PST-1.SBJ-NEG nor who-ACC 
kay-pa   pasa-q-ta} 
DEM.PROX-GEN pass-AG-ACC 
‘I didn't see anyone who passes through here.’ 
 
Although perception events are commonly associated with this type of relative clause, other 
types of verbs can use them too. In Example (166), tishqa- ‘to dock something on an island’ 
(more commonly, tishqu-) takes two co-referential direct objects marked with -ta. 
 
(166)  Tsaynash yakuqa wamrakunata aparaykashqanta, tishqaykurqunaq. 
{tsay-na-sh   yaku-qa  wamra-kuna-ta  
DEM-DISC-EVR  water-TOP child-PL-ACC 
apa-ra:-yka:-shqa-n-ta   tishqa-yku-rqu-naq} 
take-DUR-IPFV-RES-3.POSS-ACC dock.on.an.island-EXCEP-REC.PST-NARR.PST 
‘Then the water docked the children, which were being taken (by the water).’ 
 
Example (167) illustrates how this type of appositional construction (also known as “case-
floating”) can occur even without a nominalization involved. 
 
(167)  Pitsqa rapranta kukata tsarikun. 
 {pitsqa  rapra-n-ta   kuka-ta  tsari-ku-n} 
 five  leaf-3.POSS-ACC coca-ACC grab-MID-3.SBJ 
‘He takes five leaves of coca.’ (lit. ‘five leaves, the coca ones’) 
  
Other probable instances of appositional modifiers were given in (41) and (42) with existential 
ka-n and the benefactive suffix -pu expressing possession (see Section 4.6.1.1). Also, Example 
(114) could be a case of apposition with -shqa further elaborating what the co-referential noun 
looks like. 
 
4.8.4.2.2 Nominal clauses (embedding) 
In HQ, embedded nominal clauses are possible with any nominalizers described in Section 
4.4.2.1. It is possible to find cases of embedding in subject position with verbs like gusta- ‘to 
like,’ as e.g. in Example (168). 
 
(168) Parlanqayki gustan. 
 {parla-nqa-yki  gusta-n} 
 talk-ACT.NMLZ-2.POSS like-3.SBJ 
 ‘S/he likes that you talked.’  
 
However, this is uncommon with other verbs. Thus, I will focus here on direct object embedding. 
 
4.8.4.2.2.1 Complement clauses with infinitive -y 
This common type of complement clause requires that the subject of the main (inflected) verb is 
also the A (agent-like) argument of the embedded infinitive verb. It is illustrated in Example 
(169). 
  
(169)  Yarquyta munaya:. 
 {yarqu-y-ta muna-ya-ː} 
 exit-INF-ACC want-PLV-1.SBJ 
‘We want to go out.’ 
 
Verb classes that commonly take an infinitive embedded object are cognition (e.g. gusta- ‘to 
like,’ yacha- ‘to know; to learn,’ musya:- ‘to think,’ yarpa- ‘to remember’), deontic (puwidi- ‘to 
be able to,’ a Spanish loan that has replaced ati- completely in HQ), and in very few cases, the 
aspectual auxiliary qalla- ‘to begin’ (see Section 4.8.4.2.3.1). 
 
4.8.4.2.2.2  Embedding with other nominalizers (-shqa, -na, and -nqa) 
When the main verb and the embedded clause have different subjects, the nominalizers -shqa, -
na, and -nqa are used. The agentive nominalizer -q could only appear in object position in a 
relative clause. Examples (170) shows how -shqa profiles the affected object, Example (171) 
how -na profiles an event as a future occurrence, and Example (172) how -nqa profiles the fact 
that something took place: 
 
(170)  Qutsushqanta yarpankiku? 
 {qutsu-shqa-n-ta  yarpa-nki-ku} 
 sing-RES-3.POSS-ACC remember-2.SBJ-Q 
‘Do you remember what she sang?’ 
 
(171)  Yarqunaykita munaya:. 
 {yarqu-na-yki-ta  muna-ya-ː} 
 exit-POT.NMLZ-2.POSS-ACC want-PLV-1.SBJ  
‘We want you to go out.’ 
 
(172)  Mikuyanqa:ta yachan. 
{miku-ya:-nqa-ː-ta    yacha-n} 
eat-PLV-ACT.NMLZ-1.POSS-ACC know-3.SBJ 
‘She knows that we ate.’ 
 
Against Parker’s (1976: 164) observations, no limitations seem to exist for regarding verbs that 
can take an embedded clause. While this type of complex construction is not frequent in oral 
styles, they are found more often in written text with a wider variety of verbs: 
 
(173)  Cooperacion Popular kalaminata a:niya:mashqanta mana apuradu kumpliptin… 
{cooperacion popular  kalamina-ta a:ni-ya:-ma-shqa-n-ta 
Cooperation public  tin.roof -ACC agree-PLV-1.OBJ-RES-3.POSS-ACC 
mana apuradu kumpli-pti-n} 
no hurried  fulfill-SUBDS-3.SBJ 
‘When Cooperacion Popular (a government agency) didn’t hurry up to fulfill their 
agreement with us to a tin roof…’ (lit. ‘that they had said yes to us to a tin roof’) 
 
Finally, I include among nominalized embedded clauses the basic obligation construction 
expressing ‘to have to.’ It uses the potential nominalizer -na to indicate the probable nature of an 
event. In addition to this, in the present tense it uses a zero 3rd person singular form of ka- ‘to 
be.’ For other tenses, a 3rd person singular form of ka- is overtly used. Examples of this 
construction were offered in (91), (94), (95), and (139). See Table 4.15 for the obligation 
construction paradigm in the three basic tenses. 
 
<Insert table 15 here> 
4.8.4.2.3 Adverbial clauses 
In order to provide information surrounding an event’s occurrence such as cause, consequence, 
location, duration, among others, HQ uses specific subordinating suffixes or nominalized forms 
(with the exception of the agentive nominalizer -q) marked with case suffixes. In this Section, I 
will present first the subordinating suffixes -r (same subject), -shpa (gerund), and -pti (different-
subject). Then, I will move onto purpose adverbial construction using nominalizers.  
 
4.8.4.2.3.1  -r and -shpa ‘same-subject subordinator (SUBIS’), -pti ‘different-subject subordinator’ 
(SUBDS) 
Adverbial subordinate clauses present a situation in a temporal or logical relation depending on 
the inflected (main) verb. They are translated with when, while, and because. Like most 
Quechuan languages, HQ uses a switch-reference system: -r and -shpa require that the subject in 
the main and subordinate clauses are the same; if they are different, -pti is used.  
The subordinating suffix -r is not marked for nominal agreement, since it has the same 
subject as the main clause. As illustrated in Example (174), it marks a subordinate event as 
taking place prior to the main one, sometimes as a cause to the main clause. 
 
(174)  …tikakunata hurqur, allibwenu sasata paskaykurqa:. 
{tika-kuna-ta hurqu-r  allibwenu sasa-ta  paska-yku-rqa-ː} 
 bricks-ACC extract-SUBIS very  difficult-ACC release-EXCEP-PST-1.SBJ 
‘…when I took out the bricks, I released her with a lot of difficulty.’ (i.e. ‘by taking out 
the bricks’) 
 
As mentioned in Section 4.6.2.1.2.1 in connection with Example (53), the presence of -ri 
immediately before -r (as well as -pti) indicates that the subordinate has taken place as a 
completed event. An example of this is in (175). 
 
(175)  Llapanta alistarirnam, qallaykuyan amararna. 
 {llapanta alista-ri-r-na-m   qalla-yku-ya:-n   amara-r-na} 
all-3.POSS-ACC prepare-PUNC-SUBIS-DISC-EVDbegin-EXCEP-PL-3.SBJ3 tie-SUBIS-DISC 
‘After having prepared everything, they began to tie it up.’ 
 
The previous example also illustrates how qalla- ‘to begin’ takes a subordinate clause with -r 
(amara-r- ‘tying’) as its complement instead of taking an infinitive complement. A very frequent 
type of coordination in HQ presents the main clause as immediately following the event marked 
with -r, as in Example (176). 
 
(176) Huklla takllayki katarkur uryaq ayway! 
{huklla  taklla-yki  kata-rku-r    
 at.once  foot.plow-2.POSS carry.on.back-UW-SUBIS  
urya-q  away-y} 
work-AG go-IMP 
‘Hurry up, put your foot plow on your back and go to work!’ 
 
While nominal agreement is not required for same-subject reference, object agreement can be 
coded with -r by using the following combinations: -ma-r-ni-: (1st person object singular), -ma-
r-ni-ntsik (1st person inclusive object), -r-ni-yki (2nd person object), -shu-r-ni-yki (3rd person 
subject and 2nd person object.) Their plural forms take -ya: in its default position, before the 
object marker. Notice that if the subordinate sentence has a 3rd person object, then it can 
optionally take the form -r-ni-n, which is equivalent to just -r. Example (177) illustrates the use 
of -r with 1st person object marker -ma:. 
 
(177)  Imanirtan mantsamarni: ayqinki? 
{imanir-tan  mantsa-ma:-r-ni-ː   ayqi-nki} 
why-CONTR fear-1.OBJ-SUBIS-EP-1.SBJ flee-2.SBJ 
‘Why do you run away fearing me?’ 
 
The same-subject subordinator -shpa is less frequent than -r, and its use is restricted to the 
Huaraz province in the Callejón de Huaylas (cf. Parker 1976: 144). In contrast with -r or -pti, it 
never takes any type of subject or object agreement markers. While less frequent than -r, it is still 
common in my corpus. The relation between -shpa and the main clause is ambiguous, and it can 
be interpreted as simultaneous, consecutive, or previous to the main clause. In Example (178), 
due to context, only simultaneous and consecutive readings are possible:  
 
(178)  Tsaynaw nirshi, mana mantsashpa pumapa wayinman hiqarinaq. 
{tsay-naw ni-r-shi  mana mantsa-shpa  
DEM-SIMUL say-SUBIS-EVR not fear-SUBIS  
puma-pa wayi-n-man  hiqari-naq} 
cougar-GEN house-3.POSS-ALL leave-NARR.PST 
‘Having said this, he left for the cougar’s house without being afraid.’ 
 
The different-subject subordinator -pti is always marked for nominal person agreement to 
indicate the subject of the subordinate clause, as in Example (179). 
 
(179)  Tsayshi patsa wara:riptin kuntuta rika:rinaq. 
{tsay-shi patsa wara:-ri-pti-n 
DEM-EVR world be.dawn-PUNC-SUBDS-3.SBJ  
kuntu-ta  rika:-ri-naq} 
jug-ACC see-PUNC-NARR.PST 
‘Then, right after it was dawn, he looked at the jug.’ 
  
-pti can also be marked with subject-object agreement. Example (180) uses the person marker -q, 
which indicates a 1st person subject acting on a 2nd person object.  
 
(180)  Yachatsiyka:yaptiq allinta yachanki. 
{yacha-tsi-yka:-ya-pti-q    allin-ta  yacha-rqa-nki} 
 know-CAUS-IPFV-PLV-SUBDS-1.SBJ.2.OBJ good-ACC learn-PST-2.SBJ 
 ‘When we were teaching teach you, you learned well.’ 
 
A subordinate clause with -pti is viewed as occurring before the main verb. However, the use of 
aspectual suffixes further delimits the temporal relation between clauses. In Example (179), the 
punctual aspect suffix -ri indicates that the subordinate takes place right before the main event. 
On the other hand, continuous -yka; in Example (180) suggests that the main event took place 
while the subordinate event was unfolding.28  
 
4.8.4.2.3.4 Purpose constructions with nominalizers (-na-paq and -q with motion event) 
Many types of verb modifiers can be created in HQ through the use of infinitives with case 
markers. Alongside use of the genitive case -pa and the accusative case -ta to do this (see Section 
4.5.3.3.1 and 4.5.3.3.2), the ablative case -pita or the locative case -chaw can be used to specify 
causes or specific circumstances connected to any event, e.g. in Examples (181) or (182). 
 
(181) yarquyniykipita 
{yarqu-y-ni-yki-pita} 
depart-INF-EP-2.POSS-ABL 
‘because of your departure’  
 
(182)  papa allaychaw  
 {papa alla-y-chaw} 
 potato harvest-INF-LOC 
‘at the potato harvest.’)  
 
Case-based constructions include any nominalizer, except the agentive -q. 
The most frequent subordinate clause based on a case marker is the purpose construction 
with the potential nominalizer -na and the dative case -paq. The potential nominalizer indicates 
that the event has not taken place yet, but it is possible. At its most basic, -na-paq indicates a 
generic goal, e.g. in Example (183). 
 
(183) papata murunapaq 
 {papa-ta  muru-na-paq} 
 potato-ACC sow-POT.NMLZ-DAT 
 ‘in order to sow potato’ 
 
The nominal agreement markers specify the subject of the subordinate clause. However, if an 
overt subject is added, it remains in the nominative case (or as a modifier of the nominalizer), but 
it is never marked genitive, as usual with embedded clauses. This is illustrated in Example (184). 
 
(184)  …mana gendarmikuna tsariya:nanpaq.  
{mana  gendarmi-kuna  tsari-ya:-na-n-paq} 
no police-PL  catch-PLV-POT.NMLZ-3.POSS-DAT 
‘…so that the police didn’t catch him.’ 
 
This frequent purpose adverbial construction has been illustrated before in Examples (91), (94), 
(95), and (146). However, -na-paq is never used with verbs of motion. For those cases, a purpose 
construction with the agentive nominalizer -q conveys the goal. The subject is always identical 
for the motion verb and the nominalized form. An example of this construction can be found in 
Example (176),where the form urya-q ayway ‘go to work’ (lit. ‘go worker’) indicates the goal of 
 
28 See Example (28) in Section 4.5.3.3.8. for other ways to convey simultaneous events using the limitative case -
kama. 
the motion. The -q purpose subordinate can be before or after the main verb, as in Example 
(185). 
(185) yarqunki pukllaq 
 {yarqu-nki puklla-q} 
 exit-2.SBJ play-AG 
 ‘You went out to eat.’ 
 
4.8.4.2.3.5 Conditional clauses 
Conditional subordinate clauses introduce the logical condition for the main clause. There are 
two ways to introduce the conditional clause in HQ. First, the conjunction sitsun introduces this 
subordinate with an inflected verb. This conjunction comes from Spanish si ‘if’ and the 
irrealis/subjunctive marker -tsun (likely to be cognate with the injunctive marker discussed in 
Section 4.6.3.4). Although Example (186) uses a perfect conditional in the subordinate, forms in 
the present, past, or future are allowed too:  
 
(186)  Sitsun mana padrinu: kankiman karqan, ushaka:tsiqmanmi. 
{sitsun  mana  padrinu-ː   ka-nki-man  ka-rqa-n  
 if   no godfather-1.POSS be-2.SBJ-COND be-PST-3.SBJ 
 usha-ka:-tsi-q-man-mi} 
 finish-SPON-CAUS-1.SBJ.2.OBJ 
 ‘If you hadn’t been my godfather, I would destroy you.’ 
 
Conditional clauses are also introduced with subordinators -r and -pti marked with the topic 
suffix -qa. Examples (55) and (108) illustrate muna-r-qa ‘if you want’ and tari-mu-pti-yki-qa ‘if 
you don’t manage to find (food),’ both conditional subordinate clauses.

4.10 Literature 
HQ has been the object of many studies, grammars, vocabularies, and texts since the late 1960s. I 
can only mention here the most influential works and those that have served as sources for those 
analysis and descriptions offered in this chapter that diverge from those found in the previous 
literature. Parker (1976) is the first substantial reference grammar for Ancash Quechua, and it is 
based on HQ. Julca Guerrero (2009a) is a reference grammar that considers numerous contexts 
for dialectal variation. It also includes a chapter devoted to the current phonological orthography 
of Ancash Quechua. While this work includes data from all the Ancash Quechua varieties, HQ is 
the main source. Early grammars and sketches of HQ are Escribens and Proulx (1970), 
Levengood de Estrella and Larsen (1972), and the extensive introduction in Swisshelm (1972).  
Regarding dictionaries, Swisshelm (1972) organized extensive fieldwork notes done by 
José [Joseph] Ripkens in the Huaraz province. Parker and Chávez Reyes (1976) is a revision of 
Parker (1971). Amancio Chávez Reyes contributed terms from the Conchucos variety into a 
collection that was mostly a HQ lexicon. Carranza Romero’s (2003) dictionary, while based on a 
variety closer to the northern Conchucos ones, also includes terms from the Callejón de Huaylas. 
More recently, Julca Guerrero and C. Julca Guerrero (2016) have published a study of the lexical 
diversity and expressiveness in Ancash Quechua, based mostly on the Huaylas variety.  
Early works on phonology are Parker (1967, 1970) and Swisshelm (1971). The latter is a 
pioneering work containing many insights on stress, pitch, and phonotactics. Unfortunately, due 
to its limited availability, those observations have not been reviewed with modern methods yet. 
Vivas Bravo’s (2005) MA thesis studies vowel length using data from the Huaraz province. 
Morphosyntax has been studied mainly from a descriptive and typological perspective. 
Parker’ (1973a) groundbreaking work on verbal derivational morphology is based mainly on the 
Huaylas dialect, but he also uses data from his extensive fieldwork through Ancash during the 
1960s. Swisshelm (1974) is also a study of verbal derivational morphology. It has the distinction 
of being the first corpus-based study ever done in Quechuan linguistics, and it is one of the most 
comprehensive analyses of the distribution of those suffixes in any Quechua variety. Larsen 
(1976), also a study of derivational morphology, deserves mention due to the diversity of 
examples it includes. Villari’s dissertation (2017) studies the form and function of negation in 
the Huaraz province, while stressing the importance of shared knowledge and sociocultural 
settings. Villari and Menacho (2015) offer a general description of the middle voice suffix -ku. 
This topic is expanded in Molina-Vital’s dissertation (in preparation), where this category is 
analyzed in terms of control and affectedness and in relation with causatives and the proposed 
category of spontaneous voice. The interaction between environment and spatial orientation in 
the southern Callejón de Huaylas is explored in Shapero’s (2017) dissertation. While not based 
on HQ, but on the closely related Southern Conchucos variety, Daniel Hintz’s (2011) exhaustive 
monograph on verbal aspect, and Diane Hintz’s (2007) dissertation on the form and function of 
past tense markers under an interactional perspective are fundamental contributions to those 
areas of verbal morphosyntax. 
Many texts have been published in HQ. This includes not only collections aimed for 
linguistic research, but textbooks for intercultural bilingual education (e.g. Camones Maguiña 
2018), and numerous basic reading materials created by SIL and their associates (e.g. Granados 
Barreto 1995 and Colonia Macedo 2002, to mention a couple). Among collections created to 
help linguistic research, Proulx and Méndez (1967) collects stories from the Yungay province. 
Pantoja Ramos et al.’s (1974) monumental collection of stories, memoirs, folklore, and 
instructive texts from the Huaraz province is still the most valuable source of data for HQ. More 
recently, Julca Guerrero and Chávez (2009) and Julca (2017) collected academic, narrative, 
poetry, and instructional texts from different varieties of Ancash Quechua, with a significant 
majority from the Callejón de Huaylas.
