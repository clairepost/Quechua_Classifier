Abstract  
This thesis explores the meaning and function s of discourse enclitics in Tena 
Kichwa, a Quechuan language  spoken in the Ecuadorian Amazon. The enclitics 
in question are non-obligatory, word-final markers , attaching to hosts from all 
grammatical categories. Their meanings range from marking information 
structural categories to encoding the epistemic authority held by the speaker and 
the addressee. The  thesis focuses on the semantics of the markers and their role 
in structuring TK discourse.  
In the first  two chapters , I introduce the context of this study and provide a 
sketch of the grammar of  Tena Kichwa . Subsequently, I describe the  
morphosyntactic properties of all Tena Kichwa enclitics and analyse their subset 
as a paradigm of ‘discourse’ enclitics. Consequently, I discuss the role of 
discourse enclitics in marking information structure, focusing on the markers 
which indicate change of topic and con trastive, interrogative and verum foci. 
Subsequently, I describe the epistemic semantics of the enclitics =mi and =cha, 
previously analysed as evidentials  (e.g. Weber 1986; Floyd 1997; Faller 2002) . I 
show that  in Tena Kichwa, they are better analysed as markers related to 
epistemic authority. In the  final chapters, I discuss the relationship between the 
information structural and epistemic meaning of the  markers, showing that the  
enclitics form a notionally coherent morphosyntactic system, the core function of 
which is providing a structure for discourse by managing common ground. I also 
show that the non -obligatoriness of the markers can be  at least part ially 
accounted for if the notion of speaker and hearer expectation is taken into 
account.  
The analysis presented in the thesis is based on a corpus of thirteen hours of 
naturalistic discourse data, complemented by elicitation and stimuli -based tasks. 
This documentary corpus of Tena Kichwa has been deposited in the ELAR 
Archive, and will also be deposited in the Archive of Languages and Cultures of 
Ecuador.

Note on conventions 
In Ecuador, Quechua speakers call themselves ‘ Quichua’, to underline the fact that 
Quechuan languages have a three -, rather than five -way vowel distinction, as 
originally described by Sp anish missionaries. In the  official orthography used for 
Ecuadorian varieties, the language name is written Kichwa. I decided to use this 
orthography for the language name, as it is the one used by the language community 
I work with. However, when quoting work of other authors, I retain their choices of 
orthography for language names, and I use the previous, hispanicised orthography to  
refer to the name of the language family: Quechuan. 
The sources quoted in this paper use a variety of glossing conventions.  When citing 
work of other authors and u nless stated otherwise, I use the glosses, translation and 
Quechua orthography used in the original. I gloss all the Quechua discourse  markers 
as clitics, irrespective of the convention used in the source literature.  
The orthography used in Tena Kichwa  examples is based on the Unified Kichwa 
orthography, which is the official writing system for Kichwa in Ecuador, but is 
adapted slightly to reflect the phonemic distinctions present in T ena Kichwa, but 
absent from Unified Kichwa.  
Since in Tena Kichwa the nominative case and present tense  are zero-marked, they 
are not glossed in the examples given in the thesis. The same obtains for zero-marked 
3SUBJ verb agreement. M arkers combining person and number features are only 
glossed for number in the plural. 
The sources of data are always indicated below the examples. When a recording 
exists, it is reference d. In the absence of a recording, the examples are glossed 
‘attested’ if they occurred in natural discourse and ‘elicited ’ if they occurred in an 
elicitation session which was not recorded. In this thesis I provide examples in two 
formats: one with and one without orthographic transcription. In cases where 
orthographic transcription is provided it is for clarity, where the orthography does not 
reflect the underlying shapes of morphemes, or when morphemic breaks do no t align 
with boundaries of phonological words.

 Introduction Chapter 1
This thesis is an exploratory study of discourse enclitic s in Tena Kichwa, a 
Quechuan language spoken in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Over the course of this work, 
I define and identify the Tena Kichwa discourse enclitics, describe their 
morphosyntactic properties, the role they play in the information structure of the 
language, and finally – their use in discourse.  
The objective of this introductory chapter is to provide the reader with the necessary 
background information, both on the language and its speakers, and on the research 
questions and methods underpinning  this study. To this end, I first ly introduce the 
Quechuan language family and its internal subdivision. Secondly, I briefly outline 
the current sociolinguistic situation of the speakers of Tena Kichwa, the Napo Runa.1 
Thirdly, I focus on the research presented in this thesis, introducing my researc h 
questions and the methodology of data collection and analysis.  
 The Quechuan language family 1.1
This section situates T ena Kichwa in the context of the Quechuan language family. 
Firstly, I describe the internal subgrouping of Quechuan languages (1.1.1). Secondly, 
I focus on the varieties spoken in the Ecuadorian Amazon and t heir typological 
interest (1.1.2).  
 Subdivision of the Quechuan language family  1.1.1
Quechuan languages are in use along the Andes, from northern Chile and Argentina 
in the south to southern Colombia in the north, spread over a distance of about  3500 
kilometres (see Figure 1.1). The less closely related varieties might be mutually 
unintelligible, and the overall number of Quechuan dialects is still only 
approximately known (Adelaar with Muysken 2004: 168).

The first classifications of Quechuan languages were  put forward by Parker  (1963) 
and Torero  (1964). Both authors divided the language family into two groups. 
Quechua B (Parker 1963)  or Quechua I (Torero 1964)  encompasses the varieties 
spoken in the highlands of central Pe ru, considered to be ‘ the homeland of Proto -
Quechua’ (cf. Adelaar & Muysken 2004:180 –1; Mannheim 1991: 9-12). Quechua A 
(Parker 1963)  or Quechua II  (Torero 1964)  includes all the rema ining varieties. 
Torero (1964) proposed a further division of  QII into Quechua IIA, IIB and IIC. The 
Lowland/Amazonian varieties spoken in Ecuador , Colombia  and Peru , including 
Tena Kichwa, all belong to the Quechua IIB branch. In this  thesis, I use t he 
terminology proposed by Torero (1964).

Although numerous distinctions between QI and QII varieties exist on different 
levels of the grammar (see Adelaar with Muysken 2004: 183-237 for an overview ), 
the most clear-cut distinction between QI and QII is morphological. Notably, QI and 
QII use different strategies to mark first person possessor s and subjects. In QI, first 
person subject/possession is marked on both nouns and verbs  by vowel lengthening, 
as in waska-: (‘my rope’), wata-: (‘I tie (it)’). QII uses dedicated suffixes -y and -ni, 
as in waska-y (‘my rope’), wata-ni (‘I tie’) (Adelaar with Muysken 2004: 189).  
Since Quechuan languages are spoken  predominantly in the Andean highlands , 
Quechua is generally regarded as an index of indigenous, Andean identity (Adelaar 
with Muysken 2004: 180 -3). This assumption is reflected  in much greater polit ical 
visibility of, and scientific interest in , Highland Quechua varieties, as compared to 
those spoken in the Lowlands. The next section discusses the Lowland varieties in 
more detail, focusing on those spoken in Ecuador.  
 Lowland Ecuadorian Kichwa – variation and typological interest 1.1.2
The geographic spread of Lowland Quechua is limited in compari son to Highland 
varieties: they are only spoken in Ecuador, Peru and Colombia. Uzendoski and 
Whitten Jr. (2014: 1) claim that there  are about 150 ,000 speakers of Amazonian 
Kichwa varieties in Ecuador.  
The three main Kichwa dialects of the Ecuadorian Lowlands are: Bobonaza, spoken 
along the Puyo and Bobonaza rivers ; Tena along the upper Napo river; and 
Limoncocha along the Lower Napo (Orr & Wrisley 1 965). Lewis (2015) proposes 
different labels  for the three varieties : Northern Pastaza ( ISO 639 -3: qvz), Tena 
Lowland (quw) and  Napo Lowland (qvo) , respectively . The Bombonaza/Northern 
Pastaza dialect is also referred to as ‘Pastaza’ (e.g. Nuckolls 2012), or as ‘Canelos 
Kichwa’ (cf. Muratorio 1998). The geographical spread of these varieties is shown in 
Figure 1.2:

Figure 1.2 Quechuan varieties spoken in Ecuador 
 
Aschmann (2007) 
The variety with which this thesis is concerned is Upper Napo, or Tena Kichwa , 
spoken mostly in the Tena canton of the Napo Province . Speakers use the two 
language names, ‘Upper Napo’ and ‘Tena’, interchangeably. In this thesis, I 
consistently use the label Tena Kichwa (henceforth TK). According to different 
estimates, TK is spoken by between 20,000 (Lewis 2015) to 40,000 (Moseley 2010) 
people. 
To my knowledge , there are no  studies of the extent of linguistic variation between 
the different Amazonian dialects. However, the labels discussed above do correspond 
to the speakers’ perceptions of linguistic variation. While all the Ecuadorian 

 
20 
 
Amazonian Kichwa varieties are mutually intelligible, my consultants perceive 
themselves as speaking diff erently from the speakers of Pastaza and Lower Napo 
dialects. They also notice differences between themselves and Kichwa speakers from 
the neighbouring canton of Archidona (cf. Muratorio 1998: 71). Within the canton of 
Tena, variation is perceived between urban centres and rural communities scattered 
along the Napo River.  
Lowland Ecuadorian Kichwa varieties are said to be particularly interesting from the 
typological perspective (Muysken 2000) . They differ significantly in terms of 
phonology, morphology and lexicon from both th e Highland varieties, and from the 
related Lowland varieties spoken in Peru. It is in Ecuador that Quechuan languages 
are most diverse, due to widespread and prolonged contact with other  indigenous 
languages (Parker 1963) . In Ecuador, s peakers of the different varieties of 
Amazonian Kichwa have been in contact with many more indigenous communities 
than the Highland Quechua speak ers. These communities include speakers of Shuar 
and Achuar (Jivaroan), Tsafiki (Barbacoan), Cófan (Chibchan), Siona -Secoya 
(Tucanoan), Wao-Tededo (isolate) and, in previous centuries, also speakers of Tupi -
Guarani languages such as Omagua (cf. Reeve 2014) . Such extensive contact is 
partly due to the pre-colonial population dynamics along the Napo and Pastaza rivers, 
and partly to the presence of Christian missions in the region since the early 17th 
century (Muratorio 1998: chap. 5; Reeve 2014) . While Lowland Kichwa vocabulary 
related to domestic and soc ial activities is similar to that of Highland Kichwa, terms 
referring to jungle animals and plants are mostly of non -Quechua origin (Muysken 
2000: 975) . Also, ideophones, commonly present in the languages of the north-
western Amazon are much more abundant and widely used in Lowland Kichwa than 
in the Highland varieties (Connie Dickinson, p.c. ; Simeon Floyd, p.c. ; Nuckolls 
1993). Morphosyntactic influence on Kichwa from Wao Tededo and Barbacoa n and 
Jivaroan languages has been suggested in the recent literature (Muysken 2011; 
Dickinson & Muysken, forthcoming). Mutual influence between Amazonian Kichwa 
and the languages mentioned above manifests itself not only in the lexicon, but also 
in certain cultural traits ; the mythology of the Amazonian K ichwa peoples bears 
resemblances to the myths of the cultures with whom they are, or were, in contact.   
Nowadays, Spanish is the biggest contact language not only for Amazonian Kichwa 
varieties, but also for all the other indigenous languages of Ecuador. The ubiquitous 
 
21 
 
influence of Spanish on Amazonian Kichwa dialects manifests itself in numerous 
lexical and grammatical borrowings.  
 The Napo Runa 1.2
In this section, I briefly outline the social organisation of the Napo Runa (1.2.1) and 
then sketch the current sociolinguistic situation of Tena Kichwa (1.2.2).  
 Social organisation of the Napo Runa  1.2.1
As mentioned previously, the speakers of Tena Kichwa call themselves Napo Runa 
(the People of Napo) . Traditionally, they a re agriculturalist and hunters. Their main 
crop is manioc, from which they make chicha – a drink of cooked and fermented  
manioc paste mixed with water.  Chicha is of great importance for the Napo Runa 
culture, it often replaces food in times of poor crops or scarcity of money, and is 
traditionally offered to guests visiting the household , and shared during collective 
labour events called mingas, as well as other social events . The Napo Runa  are 
skilled hunters and fishermen, but in recent years  it has become difficult to rely on  
hunting for subsistence, due to decreasing numbers of wild animals in the region. In 
the communit y where I stayed, wild meat is increasingly used only on special 
occasions, and is often bought from the hunter -gatherer Waorani people, whose 
territory neighbours the lands of the Napo Runa , and extends deeper east int o the 
Amazon.  
The Runa society is structured around the kinship group, the muntun, which includes 
both consanguineal and non -consanguineal kin. A smaller unit of cosanguineal kin, 
also including spouses, is referred to as ayllu. A thorough description of Runa family 
relationships and process of kin formation can be found in Uzendoski (2005), who 
also describes the importance of the different matrimonial rites for the creation and 
maintenance of social cohesion. Another important social institution is a network of 
formalised friendships (Spanish:  compadrazgo), often used to reinforce the e xisting 
links between families or neighbours. Nowadays, the Napo Runa  often choose the 
Waorani, or non-indigenous settlers, as their compadres or comadres.  
 
22 
 
It is not clear when and how Kichwa came to be spoken in the Ecuadorian Amazon. 
Kichwa-speaking settlers might have arrived in the area around the  16th century, or, 
what seems much more likely, the local peoples might have previously spoken a 
different language, and have adopted Kichwa as a result of contact. Exploring this 
issue is beyond the scope of this work, but a wealth of anthropological literature on 
the subject exists (cf. e.g. Muratorio 1998; Uzendoski 2005; Hornborg & Hill 2011; 
Reeve 2014; Uzendoski & Whitten Jr. 2014) . As mentioned previously, the Runa 
mythological narratives (see e.g. Alvarado Narváez 2010) bear resemblances to those 
of the groups with which they are, or used to be, in contact. Uzendoski and Whitten 
Jr. (2014: 5)  suggest that the Napo Runa mythology could be considered a 
transformation of the Tupí-Guarani tradition , and that traditional Runa pottery 
indicated similar cultural influences. For interpretation of Kichwa oral tradition in 
relation to Amazonian ethnopoetics, see Uzendoski and Calapucha-Tapuy (2012). 
The historic memory of the Napo Runa traces the origins of their ethnic group to the 
warrior Jumandy, the leader of the 1578 insurgence against the Spanish  (Uzendoski 
2005; Uzendoski & Whitten Jr. 2014) . The modern-day Kichwa speaking peoples of 
the Napo identify themselves as de scendants of Jumandy, despite the fact that he  
belonged to an ethnicity known as ‘ Quijos’. In recent years, Napo Province has seen 
the re -emergence of the Quijos ‘nationality’. Around Tena, the provincial capital, 
inhabitants of several villages now call themselves Quijos rather than Kichwa , and 
separate political representation organs for Quijos have been put in place . Those who 
use this label emphasize the fact that Kichwa has only been spoken in the re gion for 
several centuries, having replaced their anc estral language. Through the process of 
Quijos resurgence, the ir aim is to re -connect with their pre -colonial, ‘pure’ 
indigenous Amazonian identity. However, since the original language of the Quijos 
has been lost, today they still speak varieties of Kichwa.  
 Current sociolinguistic situation of Tena Kichwa 1.2.2
In contemporary Ecuador, the Amazonian Kichwa are recognised as one of the 
pueblos (‘peoples’) within the Kichwa indigenous nationality , encompassing both 
Andean and Lowland Kichwa speakers. Speakers of thirteen of the major varieties of 
Andean Kichwa are all regarded as separate pueblos. On the other hand, the Kichwa-
 
23 
 
speaking inhabitants of the four Eastern provinces: Sucumbíos, Orellana, Napo and 
Pastaza, spanning over 82,000 km², are treated by the government as one pueblo.  
Ecuador is home to thirteen distinct ethnolinguistic minority groups (Minority Rights 
Group International 2014) , but only Kichwa and Shuar are recognised,  alongside 
Spanish, as ‘official languages of intercultural relations’  (ANCE 2008: art. 2) . The 
only official language of the country and its institutions is Spanish . Neither t he 
constitution, nor language - and minority -related policies  distinguish between 
Highland and Lowland Kic hwa. Moreover, the Highland Kichwa are , by and large , 
the indigenous group most present in the public discourse and the media. This 
situation often leads to the misconception that the Amazonian and Highland Kichwa 
speakers share a cultural identity.  However, the Napo Runa that I talked to did not 
feel they have anything in common with the speakers of Highland Kichwa, despite 
the fact that the varieties they speak are, to some extent, mutually intelligible. The 
speakers of the different Amazonian Kichwa varieties, on the other hand, do share a 
cultural identity, mythology, customs, and principles of social organisation.  
Muratorio’s (1998) account of the socio -economic history of the Upper Napo region 
since the 1850s tells a story of profound change over the last 160 years . These 
changes were accelerated firs t by the rubber boom (1880s -1913), and later by the 
increasing exploitation of crude oil in the region. As recently as the 1970s, the 
Kichwa living along the Napo River were predominantly monolingual. However, 
with the influx of tourists, mestizo residents , oil companies, and state educational 
provisions, the importance of Spanish for local peop le’s everyday life bega n to 
increase. Men often work for the petroleum plants, and many young people live 
outside the traditional communities and move to Tena or oth er bigger cities outside 
the province.  
In my host community most people were bilingual in Spanish. The only group whose 
knowledge of Spanish was limited – or, in very few cases, non -existent – were  
people over sixty. Those in their thirties and forties w ere bilingual in Tena Kichwa 
and Spanish and communicated in TK amongst themselves. As far  as I observed, 
people in their twenties tend to communicate in TK with their parents and partners, 
but very often, if not most of the time, switch to Spanish when ta lking to children. 
Teenagers use TK less frequently than Spanish. They have a predominantly passive 
 
24 
 
knowledge of the language, which allows them to understand their parents. Amongst 
themselves, however, they interact primarily in Spanish. Children have lim ited 
knowledge of TK, and speak in Spanish with their parents and amongst themselves. 
Narratives of culture and language loss feature frequently in the interviews that form 
part of the corpus used in this dissertation. 3 The sociolinguistic situation in my host 
community is likely to be influenced by the fact that it is situated only about 50 
kilometres away from the provincial capital, Tena. The bus ride from Tena to the 
community takes about two hours. My visits to communities further afield were brief, 
but many of my Kichwa interlocutors mentioned that in the more secluded 
settlements more young people still actively used the language.  
The province of Napo has recently undergone rapid development, particularly of 
infrastructure. Moreover, many of the Napo Runa have moved to cities. Whilst living 
in urban centres, Napo Runa begin to increasingly use Spanish rather than TK, but 
TK remains an important token of their identity. A clear discrepancy can be observed 
between people’s positive attitudes and declared allegiance to the use of Kichwa and 
their everyday linguistic practices  which are dominated by Spanish. Moreover, in a 
similar manner to that described for the Highland varieties, the use of TK is 
threatened by the introduction of Unified Kichwa within t he bilingual education 
programme (cf. Hornberger & King 1996; King 2001).4 
Bilingual education in Spanish and indigenous languages has been in place in 
Ecuador since 1986 . The network of bilingual schools, established in regions 
inhabited by indigenous communiti es, works in parallel to monolingual, Spanish 
schools in other areas. Bilingual Kichwa education is carried out in Unified Kichwa, 
a national standardized Quechuan variety agreed on in 1980 (Hornberger & King 
1996). The Unified Kichwa variety differs from Lowland Kichwa, most not ably in 
terms of phonology, morphology and lexicon. Unified Kichwa rejects lexical 
borrowings from Spanish, and as a consequence its lexicon differs significantly from 
that of the local varieties. This, in turn, is confusing for students, who perceive the 
differences between the variety they learn at school and the one spoken at home. 
Consequently, they often abandon communication in Kichwa altogether in favour of 
                                                 
3 See, in particular interviews KICHB07AGO2011PEDROCHIMBO and in_13082013, deposited in 
the ELAR Archive.  
4  However, see Uzendoski & Whitten Jr. (2014) for a positive evaluation of the role of the 
Intercultural Bilingual Education programme in language maintenance.  
 
25 
 
Spanish. Moreover, speaking Unified Kichwa is now required of Napo Runa who 
wish to participate in government-organised cultural events, including those meant to 
support local Kichwa customs (cf. Wroblewski 2014). Furthermore, the Intercultural 
Bilingual Education Board (Dirección de Educación Intercultural Bilingüe, DINEIB) 
published a dictionary, pedagogic al grammar and language teaching manual of 
Unified Kichwa,  whilst simultaneously withdrawing similar materials available in 
the local Kichwa varieties.  
To my knowledge, no official evaluation of these policies in the Napo region has 
been carried out to da te. However, similar policies have had adverse effect on 
intergenerational transmission in other communities in the past (cf. e.g. King 2001; 
Hornberger & King 1996)  and the increased shift to Spanish in Tena Kichwa -
speaking communities suggests that the languag e policy currently in place is not 
effective. In spite of the above, Tena Kichwa is classified as ‘vigorous’ (Lewis 2015), 
most likely due to the fact that the language (or rather Unified Kichwa), is recognised 
by the state and is used in education. However, this evaluation should be subject to 
further scrutiny, as current and future generations of parents are less and less likely to 
use Tena Kichwa in the home, and the vitality of the language will most likely 
decline rapidly over the next generation. 
 Research 1.3
This thesis focuses on a set of Tena Kichwa enclitics, labelled ‘discourse’ or ‘free’ in 
the literature on Quechuan languages . These enclitics have similar morphosyntactic 
properties across Que chuan varieties: t hey always occur word -finally and are not 
restricted to hosts from a particular word class . Although they are not grammatically 
obligatory or generally required for felicity of utterances, little is known about the 
factors conditioning their occurrence.  
In other Quechuan languages, the semantics of these enclitics is mostly associated 
with evidentiality and information str ucture. However, as far as I aware, none of the 
previous studies has looked into the relationship between these two aspects of their 
meaning. The objective of this thesis is to provide a detailed insight into the 
 
26 
 
distribution and meaning of the TK discours e enclitics, so as to explain not only 
where and why they occur in discourse, but also where and why they do not.  
In this section, I contextualise and delimit the research presented in subsequent 
chapters. Firstly, I specify the literature used in the des cription and analysis of TK 
grammar (1.3.1). Secondly, I define the key notions used across this thesis ( 1.3.2). 
Thirdly, I outline  my research questions and the rationale behind them  (1.3.3). 
Subsequently, I describe the process of creation of the TK corpus on which this 
research is based ( 1.3.4). Lastly, I provide an overview of the research methodology 
used in this study (1.3.5). 
  Selection of Quechuan literature 1.3.1
The Quechuan language family has been studied extensively, and it is beyond the 
scope of this work to provide an overview of, or even refer to, all the available 
grammatical descriptions of Quechuan lang uages, or relevant literature dealing with 
the different aspects of the Quechua language and culture. Nonetheless, the sources 
cited in this thesis have not been selected arbitrarily.  
To ground the discussion pertinent to the internal subdivision of the l anguage family, 
and to illustrate some general issues regarding the language family as whole, I have 
chosen the most recent monograph available (Adelaar with Muysken 2004) . As for 
the grammatical description, relatively little has been written on Tena Kichwa in 
particular (cf. Orr & Wrisley 1965; Orr 1975; 1981; O’Rourke & Swanson 2013) , 
other Ecuad orian varieties (Cole 1982; Nuckolls, e.g. 1993; 1996; 2012)  and 
Ecuadorian Quichua in general (Muysken 1995) . Of all the references above, only 
Cole’s work (1982) is a comprehensive grammati cal description. Given the scarcity 
of sources on Ecuadorian Quechua, the description of patterns encountered in Tena 
Kichwa was also infomed by a comparison with Quechuan varieties spoken outside 
Ecuador. I chose to use the grammars of Peruvian (QI and QI I) varieties as sources 
of comparative data for several reasons. Firstly, as mentioned in Section 1.1.1, the 
Quechua I varieties Peru is the ‘Quechua homeland’, from which the use of the 
language family spread further afield. Secondly, most of the available descriptions of 
evidential systems of Quechuan languages concern Peruvian QI and QII varieties. In 
describing particular aspects of the TK grammar, I sought out the literature providing 
 
27 
 
the most comprehensive description of the same grammatical phenomenon in another 
Quechuan variety. I decided to avoid using pedagogical grammars, since the 
linguistic description they provide is not aimed at linguists, but rather at language 
learners, and, as a consequence, is s ignificantly less detailed. However, I have made 
exceptions from this rule (Mújica & Goldáraz 2010; Howard 2013) in cases in which 
I could not find, or access, descriptive grammars describing the relevant linguistic 
phenomena.  
 Definitions 1.3.2
The main topic of this thesis is the TK ‘discourse markers’. As in the introduction to 
this section, I have stated that the enclitics I investigate have been referred to as 
‘discourse’ enclitics, consequently, ‘discourse’ will be the first notion I define. It has 
been defined in linguistic research in a var iety of ways and it is beyond the scope of 
this work to review them all. In this thesis, I understand d iscourse as ‘a coherent 
string of propositions’ (Dijk 2010: 182), that is, a string of propositions which is both 
coherent and cohesive (cf. e.g. Halliday & Hasan 1976; Sanders & Pander Maat 
2006), used in a communicative setting . Before elaborating on this definition, I 
introduce another important distinction – that between discourse and text.  
Halliday and Hasan define text as ‘ any passage, spoken o r written, of whatever 
length’ that form a unified whole, but also as ‘a unit of language in use’ (1976: 1). 
Their definition  does not clarify  the difference bet ween text and discourse . I 
understand ‘discourse’ as ‘text in use’ (cf. Widdowson 2004) , and therefore only 
retain the first part of Halli day and Hasan ’s definition of text . Consequently, I see 
every discourse as a text, although not every text is a discourse. I use the notion of 
‘unit of discourse’ to refer to distinct subparts of discourse, which can be sub-clausal, 
or sub-phrasal, but which form a separate unit. For instance, an exclamative utterance 
‘oh!’ is a valid unit of discourse.  
As mentioned above, discourse is cohesive and coherent. ‘Cohesive’ means that t he 
interpretation of one linguistic element depends on another element in th e same text 
(Halliday & Hasan 1976) . Consequently, cohesion is a feature of the linguistic form 
of the text. ‘Coherence’ is a more conceptual notion, which can be understood as 
logical ‘connectedness’ on the discourse level (Sanders & Pander Maat 2006:  591). 
 
28 
 
Consequently, coherence is a cognitive phenomenon, rather than an inherent property 
of texts (cf. e.g. Sanders & Spooren 2001; Sanders & Pander Maat 2006). It can arise 
as a result of interpretation of the linguistic  form, but it can also be arrived  at in the 
absence of cohesive devices in a text. Consider: 
(1.1)  
The winter was very cold. Many animals died.  
The stretch of discourse in (1.1) is not cohesive, but is likely to be interpreted as 
coherent, as the hearer will assume a causal relation between the clauses. Coherence 
relations can also arise due to discourse in context. I understand ‘discourse context’ 
as extra -linguistic aspects of the speech situation, such as situati onal and 
communicative settings, relationships between interlocutors, their social roles etc. (cf. 
Hymes 1964; 1976; Camer on 2001) . ‘Linguistic context’  is the linguistic material 
that surrounds a given unit of discourse.5  
The notions of discourse, text and context are used over the course of this thesis. In 
the subsequent chapters I deal with more specific issues, and intr oduce more specific 
notions. In  Chapter 3 , I analyse the TK enclitic as discourse markers, that is, as 
expressions which increase discourse coherence (cf. e.g. Schiffrin 1987), and define 
this and related notions in more detail. In  Chapter 4 , I describe the role of the 
markers in information structure, or ‘pragmatic structuring of proposition’ (e.g. 
Krifka 2007) and also define the related notions. In  Chapter 5, I define evidentiality 
as ‘linguistic coding of the source of information’ (Aikhenvald 2004), and discuss 
the epistemic notions related to it in more detail.  
 Research questions  1.3.3
The research presented in this thesis stems from an interest in how evidential and 
other ‘discourse’ enclitics in TK are used to furthe r communicative goals of 
discourse participants. The interaction of evidential semantics and discourse has been 
explored in several recent studies of evidentiality in non -Quechuan languages (e.g 
Michael 2008; Gipper 2011; Bergqvist 2012). These analyses show that a link can be 
                                                 
5 In scholarship on discourse markers, ‘discourse’ and ‘linguistic’ context are often referred to as 
‘context’ and ‘cotext’, respectively.  
 
29 
 
established between evidentia l and inter -subjective meaning (e.g. Bergqvist 2012) , 
and demonstrate that evidential meaning can arise as a conse quence of interactional 
contexts in which a given marker is used (cf. Gipper 2011). These and other studies 
of evidentiality and related phenomena indicate that many new insights are to be 
gained from studying ‘evidential’ and other ‘discourse’ enclitics in naturalistic 
communicative contexts. In this study, I test th is claim with respect to Tena Kichwa. 
To my knowledge, none of the previous studies of evidential enclitics in Quechua is 
based predominantly on a corpus of naturalistic spoken discourse.   
The class of TK ‘discourse’ enclitics includes enclitics analysed as evidentials in 
other Quechuan varieties, but is not limited to them. To date, only the ‘evidential’ 
subset of Quechuan discourse enclitics has been explored in detail. The existing 
studies focused either on the markers’ evidential semantics (Weber 1986; Floyd 1997; 
Faller 2002) , or on their focus -marking function (Muysken 1995; Sánchez 2010) . 
Consequently, Quechuan evidentiality is relatively well -explored, but little has been 
said on the interaction of the evidential meaning of the enclitics with their roles in 
structuring discourse. Moreover, while the enclitics in question are not 
grammatically obligatory, previous studies grant little attention to why and in what 
contexts speakers choose not to use them.  
In this thesis, I provide comprehensive descriptions of the morphosyntactic and 
semantic properties of  TK discourse enclitics, and explore how these relate to their 
role in structuring discourse. These objectives lead to several mai n research 
questions: 
a) What are the morphosyntactic properties of each marker?  
Exploring the morphosyntax of the enclitic will allow for establishing the similarities 
and differences between them, and verifying whether they can be analysed as a 
morphosyntactic paradigm. Establishing in which contexts each marker is 
ungrammatical, and those in which it is obligatory, will permit drawing some 
preliminary conclusions about their semantics. This research question is answered in 
Chapter 3, where I provide a morphosyntactic description of TK enclitics and single 
out the paradigm of ‘discourse enclitics’.

b) How do TK discourse enclitics contribute to structuring of discourse?  
In previous research, certain Quechuan enclitics were analys ed as marking 
information structural categories such as topic and focus. That fact that the markers 
in question are not syntactically obligatory raises questions as to how their 
information structure -related functions should be defined.  I answer this resea rch 
question in Chapter 4.  
c) What, if any, evidential or epistemic meanings do TK discourse 
markers encode? 
In other varieties of Quechua, the best-explored subset of ‘discourse’ enclitics are the 
evidential markers. Therefore, to provide a complete account of the TK enclitics, it is 
crucial to examine whether they too encode evidential values, and what other 
meanings they are associated with. I answer this research question in Chapter 5.  
d) Is there a relationship between the semantics of discourse enclitics 
and their role in structuring discourse? 
If the enclitics contribute to pragmatic structuring of discourse, and encode epistemic 
or evidential values, it is plausible to assume that these two aspects of their meanings 
are related. In answering this question, I explore the contribution made to the 
utterance by epistemic and information structure markers, so as to show that they do 
have a common underlying meaning. This analysis is carried out in Chapter 6.   
e) What factors, in addition to information structure and semantics, 
account for the markers’ distribution in discourse? 
Given that the enclitics are not grammatically obligatory, it could be expected that 
their occurrence s and non -occurrences in discourse can be accounted for if their 
epistemic and information structural meanings are taken into account. However, this 
is not always the case for TK discourse enclitics. Also in  Chapter 6 , I discus s 
additional factors which should be considered to provide a satisfactory account of the 
distribution of TK enclitics in discourse.

 Fieldwork and data  1.3.4
The data on which this dissertation is based was collected during two field trips to 
Ecuador, which lasted a total of ten months. In this section, I describe the location of 
fieldwork (1.3.4.1), and the TK documentary corpus created as a result of it (1.3.4.2).  
1.3.4.1 The host community 
My main field  site was the village of Nuevo Paraíso , situated  on the bank of the 
Napo River, about fifty kilometres west from Tena, the capital of the Napo Province. 
During both fieldtrips, I was generously hosted by Lydia Chimbo and her family.  
Nuevo Paraíso is a relativel y big community by local standards. As of Sep tember 
2014, 53 ‘associates’ (Spanish: socios) lived in the village, most of whom were heads 
of families. Families are formed by parents, unmarried children, and sometimes also 
widowed grandparents. They range i n size from three to about ten people, the 
average number of children per family in this particular community being about five. 
Nuevo Paraíso is accessible by river, and by a dirt road, used by the petroleum plant 
operating nearby. Buses to and from Tena pass through Nuevo Paraíso several times 
a day. Due to the poor quality of the road , covering the 50km distance takes about 
two hours , but  this is likely to change in the coming years, as  infrastructure 
development in the area is progressing rapidly. Still,  the best way to reach more 
secluded settlements and communities scattered around the area is to travel by motor 
canoe. Nuevo Paraíso was established in 1997 around a bilingual school which 
opened that same year, and its inhabitants come mostly from differ ent communities 
in the Napo province.  
In the field, I worked with a team of Kichwa researchers: Nilo Licuy, Jacobo Chimbo, 
Wilma Aguinda and Edwin Shiguango. Transcriber and translator Sofía Alvarado 
also contributed to the corpus. Several members of the team previously worked on 
the project of anthropological documentation of TK led by Patty Bermúdez of 
FLACSO Ecuador (Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales, Latin American 
Faculty of Social Sciences). Others joined the team specifically for the lin guistic 
documentation project. I found the Kichwa collaborators using the ‘snowball’ 
method, mostly in the social networks of my hosts and people involved in the 
 
32 
 
previous project. They were all native speakers of TK and bilingual in Spanish. They 
also had good computer literacy skills.  
The TK documentation project was a collaborative effort. The first step towards 
creating the TK documentation was selection of the topics to be documented. This 
was done by the Kichwa researchers, who included my suggestions  regarding the 
intended representative nature of the corpus. As a result, we documented different 
aspects of life in the village, recorded community events and conducted interviews 
with community members. Although Nuevo Paraíso was the main fieldwork locat ion, 
we occasionally travelled to different communities in the area, within the radius of 
about thirty kilometers.  
After having selected the topics to document, the next step was the selection of 
participants - experts on the topics we intended to document in the local communities. 
The Kichwa researchers selected these experts and approached about taking part in 
the project.  
I provided the team members with training in using the project’s video camera and 
audio recorder. When I accompanied the other membe rs of the research team on a 
trip to collect data, I worked as camera and sound operator , while the others  worked 
as interviewers. However, when I did not participate in the data collection at all, and 
the Kichwa researchers acted as both interviewers and camera operators. 
Another aspect of training provided to the Kichwa team members regarded software, 
as all the segmentation, transcription and translation of the recorded data was done in 
ELAN. During several training session, the team members learnt how t o use it, and 
those who joined the project first, for instance Nilo Andy, then provided training to 
those who joined later. We have ensured consistency in annotation by using  an 
ELAR annotation template (courtesy of Connie Dickinson). The Kichwa researchers 
segmented, transcribed and translated the recordings. I reviewed the transcription and 
translation, and then they were reviewed again by myself and the annotator, or 
another member of the research team. Consequently, each transcription that forms 
part of the documentary corpus was reviewed at least twice.  
 
33 
 
This process was not applied to the ‘elicitation’ part of the corpus (see Section 
1.3.4.2), in the case of which I segmented, transcribed and translated most of the 
recordings.  
1.3.4.2 The data 
The research project comprised not only the creation of the thesis, but also a 
documentary corpus of TK.  The definition of language documentation as creating a 
‘lasting, multi-purpose record of a language’ (Himmelmann 2006) is well-established 
in documentary linguistics. A ‘lasting’ record is created using technology and 
formats which will make it accessible to as many people as possible, but discussing 
the details of appropriate data formats is beyond the scope of this thesis. The other 
aspects of the definition above, however, merit some discussion, because they were 
crucial to the design of the TK corpus on which this thesis is based.  
For a collection of data to be considered ‘a record of a language’, the data it contains 
should be representative of how language is used in its natural habitat (Seifart 2008). 
That is, a corpus needs to contain data from a diverse range of  genres, varying in 
spontaneity (cf. e.g. Woodbury 2003) . The least spontaneous genres  used within a 
community include ritual discours e, certain prayers, songs and the like. The most 
spontaneous discourse genre, and the most difficult type of discourse to document, is 
everyday conversation. The different genres are likely to be of interest to different 
types of audiences, and to be useful for different purposes (cf. Woodbury 2014).  
An ideal ‘multi-purpose’ corpus would be a resource where people interested in the 
documented language for different reasons, and with  a variety of purposes in mind, 
could find the data they need. However, for practical reasons, documentary corpora 
are usually created with only certain audiences in mind. In the case of the TK corpus, 
the goal was to make it useful for the research on TK discourse markers, as well as a 
valuable and interesting resource for the TK speakers. To meet these different needs, 
the corpus was divided into three parts: naturalistic discourse, elicited discourse, and 
elicitation.  
The ‘naturalistic discourse’ part of the corpus was designed jointly with the other 
members of my research team. The purpose of this part of the corpus was to 
document discourse practices of the TK speakers, and to document topics and 
 
34 
 
practices importa nt for the Napo Runa culture. First, my Kichwa collaborators 
suggested potentially interesting topics. Then they approached community members 
who were experts on a given topic, and asked them to participate in an interview or 
demonstration. They have also acted as interviewers and facilitators of the recorded 
events. This part of the corpus includes interviews, life-stories, traditional narratives, 
two-party and multi -party conversations, monologues, ceremonial speeches, 
community events, political discourse and wedding songs. In many cases, the genres 
present in the corpus are not easily distinguished. In particular, conversations and 
traditional narratives often fuse (Howard 2012:  248), especially in interviews with 
older participants.  
The fact that the documentation was carried out with a team of researchers native to 
the community, and sometimes without my presence at all, helped to minimise the 
observer’s paradox. This is also why the  communicative events analysed for the 
purpose of this dissertation can safely be called ‘naturalistic’, if not ‘n atural’ speech. 
All ‘naturalistic discourse’ data were recorded both on audio  and video. 6 This not 
only facilitated the transcription process, but also made the analysis of the recorded 
events, especially multi -party conversations or community celebrations , much more 
accurate. Although over 24 hours of naturalistic discourse data were recorded over 
the course of the project, 11 hours were transcribed and translated into Spanish, and 
therefore could be analysed. It contains data from about forty speakers. 
The second part of the corpus contains ‘elicited discourse’, or ‘staged communicative 
events’ (Himmelmann 2006) : discourse result ing from presenting consultants with 
video and picture stimuli, or asking them  to perform specific tasks . The stimuli I 
used in this part of the corpus included e.g. the Pear Story video (Chafe 1980), and 
the tasks for two consultants from the Questionnaire on Information Structure 
(Skopeteas et al. 2006). These types of tasks allow for  obtaining naturalistic parallel 
data (San Roque et al. 2012:  137), and compare constructions used by various 
speakers in the same discourse situation. They also allow the r esearcher to control 
what information is, and is not, shared between discourse participants – a task 
unattainable when using naturalistic discourse. The ‘elicited discourse’ part of the 
                                                 
6 One of the recordings was contributed to the corpus by the members of the previous, anthropolo gical 
documentation project carried out in Nuevo Paraíso and financed by FLACSO Ecuador, but 
transcribed and translated within the current project.  
 
35 
 
corpus includes data from six speakers. I discuss it in more detail in Section 4.1.2, 
along with the methodological considerations concerning research on information 
structure.   
The third part of the corpus contains ‘elicitation’ data, that is, data coming from 
elicitation sessions with a single consultant, which do not contain coherent discourse, 
but rather utterances of individual sentences. In the elicitation sessions speakers were 
asked to translate sentences from Spanish to TK, and to judge grammaticality or 
felicity of TK utterances (Matthewson 2004: 381). Despite the fact that the analysis 
presented in th is thesis is driven by naturalistic language data, elicitation was an 
important part of the documentation process. As observed by Matthewson (2004: 
376-77), naturally occurring text cannot supply negative evidence, as it does not 
contain ungrammatical or infelicitous constructions. Moreover,  low-frequency 
constructions which might be of interest to linguists might not appear in naturalistic 
discourse even in a relatively large corpus. The elicitation data were also of crucial 
importance for obtaining data included in the TK grammar sketch (see Chapter 2). 
The ‘elicitation’ corpus includes a range of translation and judgement tasks exploring 
phenomena from different areas of the TK grammar. It also contains the single 
informant task from the Questionnaire on Informa tion Structure (Skopeteas et al. 
2006). Grammatical elicitation was conducted with three TK speakers.  
Table 1.1 provides a summary of the corpus used in this thesis. It also shows wh ich 
kinds of data were collected during which fieldwork period. During my first 
fieldwork, I focu sed on grammatical elicitation and collection, translation and 
transcription of naturalistic discourse. During the second fieldwork, I focused on 
testing hypotheses regarding discourse enclitics through elicitation and experiments 
which resulted in ‘elicited discourse’.

The ‘naturalistic’ and ‘elicited’ discourse  data shown in Table 1.1 were transcribed 
and translated into Sp anish by the Kichwa r esearchers, revised by me, and revised 
again with the transcriber to explain any unclear points.  The transcription and 
translation was carried out in ELAN. Moreover, I glossed the ‘elicited discourse’ part 
of the corpus  on the morphological level, using To olbox. When referring to the 
number of turn s given in Table 1.1 for this part of the corpus, it should be kept in 
mind that the transcribers have  only received basic training in transcription 
techniques. Consequently, the turns in the TK corpus might sometimes differ from 
what would be postulated as a turn by transcribers more familiar with linguistic 
theory and transcription conventions.  
The corpus does not include any written texts. This is a conscious decision, since my 
main interest was how discourse particles are used in dynamic , communicative 
situations. Moreover, written discourse it not readily available in TK ; all Kichwa 
publications in Ecuador are in the Unified Kichwa variety. While less formalised 
written genres, such as conversations on social media, are more dynamic and 
conform to local language norms, I did not have access to such data.

 Research methodology 1.3.5
The methodology underlying the collection of the corpus was described in Section 
1.3.4.2. Here, I focus on the methodological considerations underlying the analysis 
of the data.  
As mentioned in the title, the research presented in this thesis is corpus -based. 
Treating the TK corpus as the point of departure, I adopt a s emasiological 
perspective: I focus on certain  linguistic forms and investigate their meaning and 
functions. I discuss different aspect s of the semantics of TK discourse enclitics, 
including their role in marking information structure and their epistemic me aning. 
However, the discussion is limited to the meanings encoded by TK enclitics. The aim 
of this study is to analyse the enclitics in question, not to explore all linguistic 
strategies used to mark evidentiality or information structure in TK. 
Given that this study is of a descriptive nature, my aim was for it to remain neutral 
with respect to theories of grammar. In the discussion of  concepts such as 
Information Structure, evidentiality or epistemicity, I mention the theoretical 
grounding of how I choose to analyse these notions.  
Over the course of the analysis, I compare the patterns of the occurrence of clitics 
attested in the different parts of the corpus – elicitation, staged communicative events 
and naturalistic discourse. Comparing these three type s of data provides an insight 
into whether and how the distribution of discourse enclitics is affected by the 
communicative contexts in which they occur. Moreover, this approach clearly shows 
that analysis based only on one type of data adversely affects t he robustness of 
conclusions which can be made on its basis. This approach will be combined with 
elements of sequential analysis (cf. e.g. Gipper 2011) . Clauses containing discourse 
enclitics will be situated in a communicative sequence, including adjacency pairs (cf. 
Schegloff 2007), and the correlations between communicative goals of speakers and 
the use of discourse enclitics will be explored.

 Grammar sketch Chapter 2
This chapter is a sketch of selected aspects of TK grammar . Its aim is to give the 
reader a basic descriptions of the grammar of TK , necessary to understand the 
examples given in the following chapters. Consequently, this sketch is not meant as a 
comprehensive description. For those areas of the grammar for which comprehensive 
descriptions already exist, the discussion here is limited to a minimum, and 
references to other work are provided.  
 Phonology  2.1
In this s ection, I introduce the TK phonemic inventory (2.1.1) and discuss the basic 
features of the TK suprasegmental phonology (2.1.2). The discussion in both sections 
is based on O’Rourke and Swanson’s (2013) phonological description of TK, 
coupled with my TK data.  
 Phonemic inventory 2.1.1
In this section, I discuss the inventory of TK c onsonants ( 2.1.1.1) and vowels 
(2.1.1.2).  
2.1.1.1 Consonants 
TK has twenty one consonantal phonemes, shown in Table 2.1 below. There is a 
notable difference betwee n the consonantal inventories of TK and other Lowlands 
varieties (e.g. Orr 1975)  on the one hand, and those of better -described Highland 
Quechua on the other. In Lowland varieties, the contrast between voiced and 
voiceless plosives is phonemic. In proto-Quechua, obstruent voicing was not 
phonemic (Adelaar with Muysken 2004:  196), and the same obtains for many 
modern-day Highland varieties.  Unified Kichwa (see Section 1.2.2) orthography 
makes the same assumption. Stops are represented by graphemes p, t and k, and their 
voiced variants are considered allophones which only occur after  nasal consonants. 
In TK, voiced plosives are separate phonemes, which have developed in part due to 
the incorporation of these sounds from Spanish (O’Rourke & Swanson 201 3:110). 
Nonetheless, t he Unified Kichwa orthography influences the pronunciation of TK 
 
39 
 
speakers, who cease to voice the obstruents in all contexts when attempting to speak 
Unified Kichwa, nowadays often associated with higher prestige than the local 
Amazonian varieties (c.f. e.g. Wroblewski 2014).

** Appears word-initially in few native words 
 Adapted from O’Rourke and Swanson (2013: 109) 
 
Detailed discussion of the realisations of each of the above phonemes in word -initial, 
intervocalic, post -nasal, syllable -final, and word -final positions  can be found in 
Swanson and O’Rourke (2013).  
There is one important difference between the  inventory of TK consonants  given in 
Table 2.1, and the one  of TK proposed by O’Rourke and Swanson (2013). The 
authors postulate only the voiceless affricate phonemes, and  treat its voiced 
equivalents as allophones. In Table 2.1, I postulate voiced affricates as separate 
phonemes.  
In their description of TK, O’Rourke and Swanson remark that further investigation 
is needed in TK, ‘including low frequency vocabulary’, to determine whether [tʃ] and 
[dʒ], which they consider as allophones of /t ʃ/, are separate phonemes (2013: 111). 
My data indicate that the two sounds are separate phonemes, as evidenced by the 
following minimal pair:  
 
40 
 
  (2.1)
mandzu /mand͡ ʒu/ ‘NEG=chu’ vs manchu /mant͡ ʃu/ ‘a stinky insect resembling a 
grasshoper’  
The lexical item manchu barely occurs in the corpus, which confirms O’Rourke and 
Swanson’s observation that evidence for this phonemic contrast is likely to come 
from low-frequency vocabulary. In high-frequency lexical items , /d͡ ʒ/ occurs almost 
exclusively in po st-nasal context, while / t͡ ʃ/ is not constrained to any particular 
context, and frequently occurs after nasals.  Only considering high -frequency lexical 
item might therefore lead to an erroneous conclusion that voiced and voiceless 
postalveolar affricates are allophones of the same phoneme.  
Another phonemic contrast which I postulate in  Table 2.1 is that between voiced and 
voiceless alveolar affricates. This contrast is not considered phonemic by O’Rourke 
and Swanson (2013), but Orr’s (1975) description of Puyopongo Kichwa, a variety 
related to TK, does distinguish between two alveolar, as well as between two 
postalveolar, affricates. In my data, no example of minimal pairs involving the 
alveolar affricate sounds [t͡ s]/ and [d͡ z] was attested, but there are several examples of 
near-minimal pairs. Consider:  
  (2.2)
atsay /at͡ saj/ ‘let go!’ vs  adza /ad͡ za/ emphatic: chicha7   
Both sounds can occur in word-initial environments, preceding vowels /a/ and /i/, 
 though only /  t͡ s/ occurs before /u/ (see Section 2.1.1.2). They both occur between 
the instances of the low vowel /a/, or between hight front unrounded /i/ and and high 
back rounded /u/ . This allows concluding that the voicing contrast betwe en alveolar 
affricates is phonemic in TK. Nonetheless, this result should be corroborated with 
future research; both alveolar affricates are relatively infrequent in the corpus.   
Table 2.2 below presents the ortho graphic representation of TK consonants used in 
this thesis.

The orthographic conventions given for the TK consonants in  Table 2.2 constitute 
and adaptation of the Unified Kichwa orthography, which does not cater for certain 
phonemic distinctions made in TK, such as th at between voiced and unvoiced 
plosives. Note that the convention given above contains an idiosyncrasy - the same 
grapheme is used to represent the alveolar and postalveolar voiced a ffricate. This is 
consistent with how the community members write these two phonemes. 
2.1.1.2 Vowels 
TK has three vowel  phonemes: /i/, / a/ and  /u/, used both in native words and in 
loanwords from other languages  adapted to TK phonology (O’Rourke & Swanson 
2013: 111). All three vowels can occur in both stressed and unstressed position, as 
shown in Table 2.3:  
Table 2.3 TK vowels in stresses and unstressed positions 
 UNSTRESSED /i/ UNSTRESSED /a/ UNSTRESSED /u/ 
STRESSED /ˈi/ /ˈʃimi/ ‘mouth’ /ˈpit͡ ʃka/ ‘five’ /ˈkiɾu/ ‘tooth’ 
STRESSED /ˈa/ /ˈmaki/ ‘hand’ /ˈwata/ ‘year’ /ˈjaku/ ‘water’ 
STRESSED /ˈu/ /ˈkut͡ ʃi/ ‘pig’ /ˈuma/ ‘head’ /ˈt͡ ʃusku/ ‘four’ 
Adapted from O’Rourke & Swanson (2013: 111) 
 
42 
 
The transcription of vowels /i/ and /u/ given above is largely a matter of convention 
used across Quechuan languages, since their actual quality is considered to be closer 
to lower and more centralised variants [ ɪ] and [ʊ] (Guion 2003, cited in O’Rourke & 
Swanson 2013: 112).  
Due to extensive contact with Spanish, and many lexical borrowings from the 
language, mid vowels /e/ and /o/ are also used by TK speakers on a daily basis. They 
do not occur in words of Quechua n origin, but are found in loanwords which have 
not been adapted to TK phonology (O’Rourke & Swanson 2013:111).  
In the orthography used in this thesis, I use the graphemes ‘i’, ‘a’ and ‘u’ to represent 
the TK vowels. It should be remarked, however, that the  orthography used here is 
slightly idiosyncratic when it comes to representing the high vowels ‘i’ and ‘u’ in 
diphthongs. Due to the conventionalised manner of writing certain lexical items, the 
graphemes ‘j’ and ‘w’ are variably used to represent lateral approximants and high 
vowels in diphthongs. 
 Suprasegmental phonology 2.1.2
This section I briefly introduces the patterns of syllable structure (2.2.2.1) and stress 
assignment (2.2.2.2) in TK.  
2.1.2.1 Syllable structure 
When two adjacent vowels occur in TK, one of the high vowels is always realised as 
a central approximant, leading to the occurrence of falling diphthongs:  
  (2.3)
a. /tiˈɡɾa-u̯ -n/     turn-PROG-3    ‘s/he is turning’ 
b. /pukˈʎa-u̯ -n/  play-PROG-3     ‘s/he is playing’ 
O’Rourke & Swanson (2013: 112) 
In (2.3), the progressive marker / -u/ forms a falling diphthong with the preceding 
nucleus. The syllable structures showcased above are CV(C) and (C)CVVC. Taking 
the above as evidence that falling diphthongs occur in TK, O’Rourke and Swanson 
 
43 
 
(2013: 112) analyse instances of glide (or semivowel) following the nucleus as 
falling diphthongs also where the coda consonant is absent:  
   (2.4)
a. /ˈpai̯ .-wa/  s/he-INS8  ‘with him/her’ 
b. /ˈkau̯ .sa-n/  live-3   ‘s/he lives’ 
Adapted from O’Rourke & Swanson (2013: 112) 
Examples in (2.4) add another syllable type to the ones listed previously: CVV.  
With respect to syllable structure, evidence for the occurrence of rising diphthongs is 
less clear than for the falling ones. Complex onsets exist in TK, as shown in (2.3 a), 
but complex onsets in combination with a glide were not attested. Consequently, 
examples in  (2.5) are analysed as instances of complex onset containing a central 
approximant, rather than a rising diphthong (O’Rourke & Swanson 2013: 112-3): 
  (2.5)
a. /ˈtja-n/   exist-3   ‘(s)he/it exists’ 
b. /ˈtja-u̯ -n/  exist-PROG-3  ‘(s)he/it is existing/living’ 
Adapted from O’Rourke & Swanson (2013:112-3) 
In line with the above, (2.5 a) represents a falling diphthong preceded by a complex 
onset, rather than a triphthong (O’Rourke & Swanson 2013:  113). Al though 
confirming this claim needs additional research, it could be postulated that only 
falling diphthongs occur in TK. Consequently, semi -vowel sounds in syllable onsets 
should always be analysed as central approximants:

Lastly, when two identical vowels occur adjacently, they are interpreted as a long 
vowel, rather than a diphthong. In my corpus, this pattern was only attested for /i/:  
  (2.7)
/ˈwasi-i/ > [waˈsiː]    house-LOC  ‘in [the] house’ 
O’Rourke & Swanson (2013:113) 
In sum, the syllable structures attested in TK are of the types (C)V(C) and 
(C)CVV(C). The most frequent syllable type attested in TK is CV. The minimal 
word also has this structure, as in ri! (/ɾi/,‘go!’).  
2.1.2.2 Stress 
In Quechuan languages stress typically occurs on the penultimate syllable, and TK is 
no exception in this regard. This conclusion has been corroborated by visual and 
auditory inspection of pitch tracks of carefully selected tokens. The stressed syllables 
were identified based on the qualitative analysis of the correlates (pitch,  intensity, 
duration).  
In certain cases, however, stress falls on the ultimate syllable . This tends to be the 
case for disyllabic ideophones, e.g. tulún tulún : ‘ sound of falling stones’. It also 
applies to nouns affixed with the locative marker -y. Consider (2.7) above and (2.8) 
below:  
  (2.8)
/'pun.dza/     ‘day’  vs      /pun'dza -i̯ /  day-LOC    ‘on [the] day’ 
O’Rourke and Swan son (2013: 113) observe that the locative suffix only affects 
word stress of polysyllabic words ending in a vowel, which is confirmed by the 
examples above. They also list other suffixes which shift the word stress of their 
hosts to the last syll able: the present tense suffixes / -n/ (3SG) and / -nun/ (3PL), as 
well as the suffix /-nɡax/, which I analyse as ‘purpose’, and they gloss as ‘used to 
express future obligation' . While my data confirm O’Rourke and Swanson’s 
observation related to stress shift for the latter two suffixes, in my corpus the 
interaction of the suffix /-n/ with stress seems to be optional. Although exploring this 
issue in detail is beyond the scope of this work, initial observation suggests that the 
 
45 
 
interaction of /-n/ with stress might depend on the position of the verbs in the clause, 
and may be influenced by the intonation pattern of the utterance in which it occurs.   
Secondary stress might be perceived on either the first or the second syllable of some 
words (O’Rourke & Swanson 2013:113) , but detailed discussion of it is beyond the 
scope of this work. Our knowled ge of other prosodic features of TK, including 
intonation, is still limited, and discussing them also goes beyond the scope of this 
sketch grammar. In Chapter 3, I come back to lexical stress, discussing how it 
interacts with TK enclitics.  
 Morphology of major word classes 2.2
TK exhibits morphological characteristics typical of the Quechuan language family. 
It is agglutinative and almost exclusively suffixing .9 Its derivational and inflectional 
patterns are very regular, with limit ed occurrence of phonemic alternations.  It 
exhibits Nominative-Accusative morphosyntactic alignment , and  the predominant 
word order  tends towards  SOV. Quechuan varieties, including TK, have two 
different patterns of inflection: verbal and nominal.  Consequently, many previous 
studies postulate two major open grammatical classes  in Quechua: Nouns and Verbs 
(cf. Parker 1969; Lefebvre & Muysken 1988; Weber 1989).  
In this section, I discuss the inventory of TK word classes. The distinctions I propose 
are based on morphological, syntactic and semantic criteria.  I discuss the two macro-
classes associated with differing patterns of inflection: Verbs (2.2.1) and Nominals 
(2.2.2). Nominals encompass Nouns, Adjectives and several minor sub-classes. I also 
posit several minor non-nominal word classes (2.2.3). 
The lexical items I consider here are  bound and free  roots. Consequently, 
derivational and inflectional suffixes, as well as enclitics 10, are excluded from the 
discussion of word classes. Nominal and verbal derivation and inflection is discussed 
in detail in Sections 2.3 and 2.4, respectively. Enclitics, the occurrence of which is 
                                                 
9 The only prefix in my data is a nominal derivational prefix la-, added to kinship terms to derive 
terms for corresponding stepfamily members (e.g. yaya ‘father’, layaya ‘stepfather’, mama ‘mother’, 
lamama ‘stepmother’). As far as the data show, the productivity of la- is limited to kinship terms.  
10 Given that TK is an (almost) exclusively suffixing language, with respect to TK the terms ‘clitics’ 
and ‘enclitics’ are used synonymously in the reminder of this thesis.

not restricted to a particular word class, are  analysed in the subsequent chapters of 
this thesis. 
It is prudent to mention that some studies of Quechuan languages distinguish a word 
class of ‘Ambivalents’. Parker (1969) describes it for Ayacucho (QIIC) and Floyd 
(2011) for Highland Ecuador ian Quechua (QIIB). Ambivalents  ‘function both as 
substantives and verbs’ (Parker 1969: 24–5) and are ambiguous with respect to their 
syntactic and semantic properties (Floyd 2011).  
In the TK corpus, certain stems exhibit mixed patterns of inflection, making their 
word-class membership ambiguous between V and N, N and Adj , V and Adj, or 
between all three classes. The ‘prototypical’ TK Verbs are bound roots which take 
verbal morphology and their category membership can only be changed through 
nominalisation (see Section 2.4.1.3). Prototypical TK Nominals are free roots, t aking 
nominal morphology, and can be turned into verb stems by denominalising 
morphology (see Section  2.3.1.1). The ‘ambivalent’ lexical items can take eithe r 
nominal or verbal morphology without any derivational operations app lied to them. 
Consider the syntactic behaviour of a ‘prototypical’ verb root miku- ‘to eat’:   
  (2.9)
a. mishki   miku-na-ra  miku-w-ni 
          sweet  eat-INF-ACC  eat-PROG-1 
 ‘I am eating tasty [lit. sweet]  food.’ 
b. *mishki   miku-ra miku-w-ni  
    sweet  eat-ACC eat-PROG-1 
elicited 
In (2.9 a), the verb root is affixes with the infinitive -na to derive a noun mikuna 
‘food’, the direct object of the inflected verb miku- ‘to eat’; (2.9 b) shows that the 
verb ro ot cannot be used as an argument if it occurs without the nominalising or 
infinitive suffix. This contrasts with the syntactic behaviour of the ‘ambivalent’ stem 
in (2.10):  
 
 
 
47 
 
  (2.10)
a. shindzi   tamya  
 strong  rain 
 ‘heavy rain’ 
b. ashka   tamya-w-n 
 much  rain-PROG-3 
 ‘It is raining a lot.’  
attested 
In (2.10a) tamya ‘rain’ is the head of an NP, and in (2.10 b) it functions as the main 
verb, without any denominalising morphology. T herefore, it could be analysed as 
‘ambivalent’ (Parker 1969). However, I choose a simpler analysis: that certain verbal 
and nominal stems can be homophonous.  
 Verbs 2.2.1
The division between TK verbal and nominal roots can be unambiguously 
established on the basis of their morphology. TK Verbs are an open class of bound 
roots, mostly disyllabic, and always vowel -final (see example (2.9)) They comply 
with semantic and syntactic characteristics proposed for the verb as a cross-linguistic 
category: they denote actions or processes, and lack special cod ing when used 
predicatively (Croft 1991: 67; Haspelmath 2012: 124).  
TK v erbal derivational processes include valence adjustment, modification of 
Aktionsart, and several kinds of nominalisation. Verbal inflection is the most 
complex part of TK morphology ; verbs infle ct fo r aspect, tense, mood, subject,  
object and number. Verbal morphology is discussed in Section 2.4, and the structure 
and syntactic properties of VPs – in Section 2.5.2.3. 
 Nominals 2.2.2
TK Nominals are free roots, inflecting for case and number. They encompass ‘thing 
roots’ and ‘property roots’ ( cf. Haspelmath 2012: 124), which are mostly disyllabic, 
as well as different types of pro-forms, which are monosyllabic.  
 
48 
 
Those semantically distinct types of roots vary with respect to their syntactic 
behaviour in the ‘three major propositional -act types: reference, predication and 
attribution’ (cf. Croft 1991:  67; Haspelmath 2012:  124). Before proceeding to the 
description of the nominal sub -classes, I briefly discuss how ‘thing -roots’ (denote 
entities) and ‘property -roots’ (denote prop erties) behave with respect to the three 
propositional types mentioned above. Note that it is traditionally assumed that 
Quechuan languages lack the class of ‘ Adjective’ (cf. Floyd 2011 for discussion and 
an opposing view ). However, as pointed out by Haspelmath (2012), an adequate 
description of word classes is not a matter of labels they are assigned, but of an 
accurate description of the properties they exhibit. In this thesis, I distinguish nouns 
(‘thing-roots’) and adjectives (‘property -roots’) as two sub -classes of TK nominals, 
on the basis of the fact that the former, but not the latter, can function referentially/as 
phrasal heads in all contexts (see discussion below). An alternative analysis could be 
that thing - and property -roots belong to the same lexical class, but the modifier 
position precedes the position of the semantic head. 11 These two analyses, however, 
differ only  in terms of labels, and n ot of  properties they assign to thing -root and 
property-roots. In what follows, I choose to use ‘ adjective’ as a label, as doing so 
allows to more clearly distinguish outliers among the TK free enclitics (see Section 
3.3.2.11).  
Both thing-roots and property-roots can be used predicatively with the copula a- (‘to 
be’): 
  (2.11)
a. Paula   warmi   a-n 
 NAME  woman  COP-3 
 ‘Paula is a woman.’ 
b. Paula   sumak   a-n 
 NAME  good  COP-3 
 ‘Paula is pretty.’  
elicited 
                                                 
11 Thank you to Eva Schultze-Berndt for pointing this out.  
 
49 
 
Example (2.11a) is of an equative nominal predicate, and (2.11 b) – of an adjectival 
predicate. All other types of TK Nominals can also be used predicatively – examples 
of such constructions are abundant across the chapters of this thesis.  
Nouns and Adjectives also behave the same way in attribution:  
  (2.12)
a. kamba  warmi   allku 
 kan -pa  warmi  allku 
 2SG-GEN woman  dog 
         ‘your female dog’ 
b. kam-ba  sumak   allku 
 2SG -GEN good  dog 
 ‘your good dog’ 
elicited 
Both examples in  (2.12) show of possessive NPs headed by the noun allku (‘dog’). 
They demonstrate that both ‘thing’ and ‘property’ roots can be used as pre -nominal 
attributive modifiers without additional morphological mark ing. A difference 
between TK Noun and Adjective is that while adjectives can precede nouns within an 
NP, nouns cannot precede adjectives (cf. Floyd 2011; Haspelmath 2012:117 , see 
Section 2.5.2.2).  
The last propositional -act type considered by Croft (1991: 67) is reference. In TK, 
both nouns and adjectives can be used referentially. Nouns are ref erential 
independently of the discourse context. For an adjective to be referential, however, 
the referent which it describes needs to be identifiable for both the speaker and the 
addressee12: 
  (2.13)
a. Yolanda  mishki   sopara  yanuka. 
 Yolanda  mishki  sopa-ta  yanu-ka 
 NAME  sweet  soup-ACC cook-PST 
 ‘Yolanda cooked [a] tasty soup.’ 
                                                 
12 See Chapter 4 for discussion of identifiability.

b. ?Yolanda  mishki-ra  yanu-ka 
     NAME  sweet-ACC  cook-PST 
    ‘Yolanda cooked [a] tasty [one].’ 
   el_02122014_01  
While (2.13 b) is gramm atical, it requires an appropriate discourse context to be 
felicitous. Nouns are the only sub -class of TK Nominals which can be used 
referentially independent of the context. All the other sub -classes pattern with 
adjectives in this respect. Below, I brief ly introduce the different sub -classes of TK 
Nominals.  
2.2.2.1 Nouns 
TK nouns designate entities, such as persons, places and things (c.f. Schachter & 
Shopen 2007: 5). Noun roots are unbound and mostly disyllabic. As shown above, 
they can be used referentially in any discourse context, and can also be used 
attributively, or predicatively, when used with the copula a- (‘to be’). 
There is no grammatical gender in  TK, nor a distinction between count and mass 
nouns. Nominal stems are ambiguous for number, and the plural marker / -guna/ is 
not always used in cases when the referent of the noun is plural. Nouns take more 
derivational morphology than any other sub -class of nominals (see Section  2.3.1). 
Nominal stems can also be derived from verbs by means of nominalising 
morphology (see Section 2.4.1.3). 
2.2.2.2 Adjectives 
TK adjectives are descriptive mod ifiers of nouns, but can also function referentially 
when the referent they modify is identifiable, and the noun denoting the referent is 
elided. As far as the data show, all adjectives expressing gradable concepts can be 
modified by degree adverbials:  
  (2.14)
kamba  yapa  sumak   / *sumajkuna  ushiwna 
kan -pa yapa  sumak /    sumak-guna ushi-guna 
2SG -GEN very  pretty  /    pretty-PL  daughter-PL 
‘your very beautiful daughters’ 
elicited 
 
51 
 
Example (2.14) shows that when used attributive ly, TK adjectives do not agree with 
the nouns they modify in either gender (which is not grammatically marked) or 
number.13 It also demonstrates that, within TK NPs, the modifier always precedes the 
item it modifies (see Section 2.5.2.2).  
2.2.2.3  Minor nominal word classes 
There are several minor nominal sub -classes in TK. Here, I describe the basic 
properties of Pronouns ( 2.2.2.3.1) and Numerals ( 2.2.2.3.2). I first outline the ir 
shared properties, and subsequently focus on the differences.  
Both pronouns and numerals can function referentially on the same basis as 
adjectives, but they cannot be modified by adverbs, which they precede within the 
NP. Compare (2.14) above with (2.15): 
  (2.15)
a. chi   yapa  sumak   warmi-guna 
     D.DEM  very beautiful woman-PL 
     ‘those very beautiful women’ 
b. ishki  yapa  sumak  warmi-guna 
 two very beautiful woman-PL 
 ‘two very beautiful women’ 
elicited 
As shown in  (2.15), when adjectival and adverbial modifiers are present, both 
pronouns and numerals precede them within the NP. Like other nominal modifiers, 
pronouns and numerals do not agree in number with the noun they  modify. They do 
take plural marking, however, when occurring predicatively, as in  (2.16), or 
referentially, as in (2.17):  
 
 
                                                 
13 The adjectives can be modified by the plural marker when not used attributively, e.g. malta-guna 
shamu-nun (young -PL come -3PL, ‘The young ones are coming’).  Compare with the use of PL 
marking on a numeral in (2.16). 
 
52 
 
  (2.16)
pichka-guna=mi    [a-nun] 
five-PL=mi  [COP-3PL] 
‘[there are] the five [of them] ’

‘[the farmers] will catch them [the boys]’ 
el_24092014_03   74 
As shown above, both pronouns and numerals precede adverbs and adjectives within 
the NP. When occurring in the same NP, the pronoun precedes the numeral:  
  (2.18)
Comunidadpaj,   chay   ishki  motowaraña. 
comunidad-pa-k  chi  ishki motowaraña 
community-GEN-BEN D.DEM two strimmer 
‘Those two strimmers [are] for the village [lit. community].’ 
ev_04102013_10   069 
Below, I briefly discuss the morphological and semantic properties constitutive of 
the two word classes.  
 2.2.2.3.1 Pronouns 
Three sub-classes of pronouns are attested in the TK corpus:  
i. Personal pronouns: ñuka (1SG), kan (2SG), pay (3SG), ñukanchi (1PL), 
kanguna (2PL), payguna (3PL). Possessive and personal pronouns are 
homophonous. 
ii. Demonstrative pronouns/determiners: proximal kay ‘here’ and distal chi/chay 
‘there’. 
iii. Interrogative pronouns: pi ‘who’, ima ‘what’ or may ‘where’ etc.    
 
53 
 
Pronouns are nominal roots which are mostly monosyllabic, and which can either 
replace referential nouns in discourse (personal and interrogative pronouns), or  
modify them (demonstrative pronouns/determiners).  
While personal and demonstrative pro nouns can be modified by quantifiers such as 
tukuy ‘all’, interrogative pronouns tend not to be modified. All three classes of 
pronouns inflect for numbers and case.  
 2.2.2.3.2 Numerals 
As shown above, TK numerals can function attributively, referentially and 
predicatively. Cardinal and ordinal numerals are homophonous in TK. The TK 
numeral system is decimal. Nowadays, Spanish numerals are very often used by TK 
speakers, especially when the number in question is higher than ten.   
The inventory presented above does n ot encompass all TK lexical items which can 
take nominal morphology. More work is needed to establish the category 
membership of items such as tukuy (‘all’) or karan (‘every’) which quantify over 
nouns, but seem to vary e.g. in terms of whether or not they can be used referentially.  
 Minor non-nominal word classes 2.2.3
In this section, I introduce the word classes of Adverbs ( 2.2.2.3.1) and Particles 
(2.2.2.3.2). It is prudent to mention that these are no t the only two remaining word -
classes of TK. A class which does exist, but will be not be discussed here for reasons 
of space, are Ideophones – a class of sound -symbolic expressions common in 
Amazonian languages. For their detailed description in Pastaza Q uichua, a variety 
closely related to TK, see Nuckolls (1996).  
2.2.3.1 Adverbs  
Adverbs modify both Adjectives and Verbs. Adverbial roots do not take any 
inflectional morphology. This class includes adverbs of manner and degree (see (2.15) 
above), as well as temporal deictic expressions such as kuna ‘today, now ’, kaya 
‘tomorrow’ or kayna ‘yesterday’. Adverbs can also be derived from  Adjectives with 
the ACC suffix /-ta/ (see Section 2.2.2.3.2):  
 
 
54 
 
  (2.19)
a. sumak   warmi 
 pretty  woman 
 ‘beautiful woman’ 
b. sumak-ta tushu-nguichi 
 pretty -ta dance-2PL 
 ‘You (PL) dance beautifully.’ 
elicited 
In (2.19a), the adjective sumak ‘pretty’ modifies a noun. In (2.19 b), affixed with the 
Accusative /-ta/ (see Section 2.3.2.2), it functions as an adverb.  
2.2.3.2 Particles 
This class includes free stems, which tend not to take any inflectional morphology. 
They include negative parti cle mana and affirmative ari, as well as discourse 
connectives such as shinakpi ‘therefore’, chiraygu ‘then’/‘consequently’, shina ‘like 
this’, among others. The phonological shape of many of the items in this class 
suggests that they are collocations whic h became grammaticalised as discourse 
connectives. Consider: shina-kpi (like.this-SWREF), chi-raygu (D.DEM-CAUSAL). 
 Nominal morphology 2.3
Nominals inflect for number and case , and b oth these categories are encoded by 
bound suffixes. The last inflectional ‘slo t’ is occupied by ‘independent affixes ’, or 
clitics, which attach to both nominal and verbal stems, and fulfil a range o f 
pragmatic/discourse functions (see Chapter 3). The ordering of TK nominal suffixes 
is presented in Figure 2.1.

The structure of nominals in TK, a nd in Ecuadorian Kichwa in  general, is less  
complex than in other Quechuan varieties. According to Cole (1982: 6), this is due to 
processes of morphological simplification, which led, among other changes, to the 
loss of subjec t-verb agreement in nominalised subordinate clauses in all Ecuadorian 
varieties. Moreover, while in most Quechuan languages possessive relations are 
indicated on both the head and the dependent nominal, it is not the case in the 
Ecuadorian varieties. In TK , this simplification is more far -reaching still, since even 
the genitive marker on the possessor is also not obligatory. Compare analogous 
structures from the Peruvian variety of South Conchucos (QI) and TK: 
  (2.20)
a. South Conchucos Quechua (QI)  
      chakra -ntsik    -kuna     -pita  =mi 
      field -12   -N.PL   -ABL =DIR.EV

       1PL               field-PL-ABL(=mi) 
       from our fields 
elicited 
Examples in (2.20) above illustrate the differences in nominal morphology between 
the more ‘conservative’ Quechua varieties (see Section 1.1) and TK.  
Before I discuss nominal derivation ( 2.3.1) a nd inflection ( 2.3.2), it is in order to  
explain how those two terms are used in this thesis. Canonically,  I understand 
derivation as a sum of morphological processes that result in the change in the 
meaning of the lexeme, and – possibly, but not necessarily – in the change of its 
syntactic category. The term inflection, on the other hand, applies to morphological 
processes that have ‘grammatical’, rather than ‘lexical’ meaning. They are 
determined by the syntactic role of the l exeme, and are semantically more regular 
than the derivational processes (cf. Kroeger 2005: 250-9).  
 
56 
 
 Derivation 2.3.1
In this section , I  describe some derivational processes that apply to TK nominal s. 
The aim is not to provide a comprehensive list of the processes in question, but rather 
to briefly demonstrate how they function. To this end, I discuss three examples of 
nominal derivational morphology : the verbalizer -ya- (2.3.1.1), the diminutive/  
augmentative suffixes (2.3.1.2), and the ‘proprietory’ suffix -yuk (2.3.1.3).  
2.3.1.1 Verbaliser -ya-   
The verbali sing suffix is perhaps the most ‘prototypical’ example o f nominal 
derivation in TK, since it derives a new lexeme from  the host it suffixes to , and the 
resulting lexeme belongs to a different grammatical category. It can attach to both 
nouns and adjectives.   
  (2.21)
a. llandu  tuta 
 dark night 
 ‘[a] dark night’ 
b. ña   tuta-ya-w-n  
 already  night-VLZ-PROG-3 
 ‘It’s already getting dark.’  
attested 
Example (2.21) illustrates the effect of -ya- on the noun, tuta (‘night’). In (2.21a), it 
functions as a head of an NP. In (2.21 b), suffixed with -ya-, it functions as a verb 
which takes aspect and tense/person agreement.  
2.3.1.2 Diminutive and augmentative suffixes 
Speakers of TK make extensive use of diminutive and augmentative  suffixes. 
Diminutive affixes -wa and -waya are used to indicate emotional proximity or 
compassion, and can be used with a ny noun, including proper names. They are often 
used for kinship terms. Compare mama ‘mother’ and mamawaya ‘mommy’.  
The augmentative -sapa has an evaluative meaning, and is used to indicate 
exceptionally big size, or to convey negative attitude towards th e object or person in 
 
57 
 
question. It also often gives rise to figures of speech, e.g. to synecdoche. Compare: 
maki – ‘hand(s)’, makisapa – ‘long hand(s)’/‘a person with long hands’; ñawi – 
‘eye(s)’, ñawisapa – ‘big eye(s)’/‘a nosy person’. Another augmentative suffix, -ruku, 
clearly derived from the adjective ruku ‘old’, also indicates the speaker’s emotional 
proximity with the referent of the noun it modifies. It suffixes most often, if not 
exclusively, to animate nouns denoting people , e.g. kumbaruku (kumba-ruku), 
meaning roughly ‘my old pal’.  
2.3.1.3 Proprietory suffix -yuk 
The cognates of this suffix are attested in other Quechuan varieties. For Cuzco (QII), 
it is glossed as a possessive marker (Faller 2002), and for Highland Ecuadorian (QII), 
as ‘with’ (Floyd 2011) . The data suggest that in TK  the marker has  a different 
meaning. It does not simply mark  an instrumental argument role, which is expressed 
with the instrumental -wa (see Section 2.3.2.3.3). Consider:  
   (2.22)
a. kullki -yuk   shamu-ni  
 money-PROP  come-1 
 ‘I come with money/as a man with money.’ 
b. *kam-ba   kullki-yuk   shamu-ni  
   2SG-GEN money-PROP  come-1 
   Intended: ‘I come with your money.’ 
elicited 
Example (2.22b) is judged ungrammatical, which confirms that the TK -yuk cannot 
simply be glossed as ‘with’. However, the grammatical ity of (2.22a) suggest that the 
marker encodes a meaning associated with accompaniament and/or possession. 
Examples in (2.23) confirm this:  
  (2.23)
a. iksa-yuk   warmi 
 stomach-PROP  woman 
 ‘[a] pregnant woman ( lit. with a stomach)’ 
 
 
58 
 
b. shungu-yuk  runa 
 heart-PROP  person14 
 ‘[a] mature man’ / ‘[a] true man (lit. with a heart)’ 
attested 
The fact that (2.22a) and both examples in (2.23) are grammatical also shows that the 
suffix is not associated with specifically with either alienable or inalienable 
possession. Note that in all three cases given above, the -yuk-suffixed modifier seems 
to encode a certain property of the referent it modifies: a woman with a belly is a 
pregnant woman, a man with money is a rich man, and a man who has a heart [in the 
right place] is a mature person. All uses of the TK -yuk seem to have this in common: 
they derive a characteristic of an entity from a fact that it possesses a certain object. 
For the purpose of this thesis, I gloss the suffix as ‘proprietory’, but further research 
is needed into the semantics of -yuk, and into its interaction with  possessive 
morphology, including the Genitive -pa (see Section 2.3.2.3.4) and the Instrumental -
wa (See Section 2.3.2.3.5).  
 Inflection 2.3.2
This section describe s the TK nominal inflection. As mentioned previously, in TK 
and other Amazonian Quechua varieties, nominal inflection is less complex than in 
other varieties of Quechua . In the sections that follow, I firstly discuss contextual 
inflection: Number (2.3.2.1 ) and Cas e (2.3.2.2) . Consequently, I describe inherent 
inflectional suffixes which encode peripheral case-like meanings (2.3.2.3). 
2.3.2.1 Number 
In TK, like in other Quechuan varieties (cf. e.g. Parker 1969: 28), nominal stems are 
ambiguous with respect to number. A plural suffix -guna can be added to the stem of 
count nouns for it to acquire an explicit plural meaning:  
 
 
 
                                                 
14 Runa means ‘Kichwa man’, or ‘Kichwa person’. I gloss it as ‘person’ for the sake of brevity.

ñuka  churi-guna atun-guna=mi 
1SG  son  -PL big  -PL=mi 
‘My sons  are big.’  
el_12092013    183 
The suffix makes the plural number of its host explicit, but is by no means obligatory: 
compare (2.24) with (2.18) above. In (2.24), the adjective atun (‘big’) is used 
predicatively. When used attributively, a djectives tend not to agree with the head in 
either number or case:  
  (2.25)
atun  aychawnara    apamuk….   
atun aycha-guna-ta   apamu-k   
big animal-PL-ACC  bring-AG.NMLZ  
‘[the man in the old days] used to bring big animals [from a hunt]…’  
KICHB07AGOPEDROCHIMBO2   215 
Many TK speakers who are exposed to Unified Kichwa tend to use the Unified 
variant of the PL marker: [-kuna].  
2.3.2.2 Case 
TK exhibits the Nominative -Accusative pattern of alignment , typical of Quechuan 
languages. Consequently, there are two grammatical cases in TK, associated with the 
core arguments:  
i. Nominative: zero-marked 
ii. Accusative: -ta, with allomorphs: [-ɾa] (postvocalically); [-da] (after nasals). 
Nominative and Accusative case inflection is contextual – required by the syntactic 
structure of the clause (e.g. Booij 1996) . Subject arguments of both transiti ve and 
 
60 
 
intransitive clauses occur in the Nominative case, and are zero -marked.15  Direct 
objects occur in the Accusative case. Consider:  
  (2.26)
Maria   Wandzura    wajtan. 
Maria    Juan -ta    wajta -n 
NAME   NAME-ACC   hit   -3 
‘Maria hits Juan.’ 
el_310502013_1 118 
Example (2.26) shows the prototypical  use of the TK Accusative marker. However, 
the role of the ACC marker in TK morphosyntax is far from limited to marking direct 
object NPs (cf. Floyd 2011: 44  for discussion of ACC in Highland Ecuadorian 
Quichua). When the marker occurs on NPs in transitive clauses, as in (2.26), it marks 
the direct object relationship . In ditransitive clauses, it can occur on both direct and 
indirect objects. On some indirect objects (see Section 2.5.1.2.2), the ACC can occur 
interchangeably with the Dative/Lative -ma: 
  (2.27)
Pablo   sisagunara         kuyan    Mariama       /     Mariara 
Pablo    sisa-guna-ta    kuya -n  Maria  -ma     /    Maria-ta 
NAME  flower -PL-ACC         give -3 NAME-DAT  /   NAME-ACC 
‘Pablo gave Maria flowers.’ 
el_310502013_1 240 
Although /-ma/ can occur on indirect objects, it is an inherent, rather than contextual 
inflectional marker. When functioning as an indirect object marker , it is always 
interchangeable with the A ccusative. It also attache s to non -term arguments with 
semantic roles of goal and recipient  (see Section 2.3.2.3). In these contexts, it is not 
interchangeable with the Accusative suffix.  
                                                 
15My use of the term  ‘zero-marked’ follows Bybee (1994), who defines a zero -marker as  a marker 
‘with semantic content, but without overt realization in the form of a morpheme’. For a more in -depth 
discussion of the terms ‘unmarked’ and ‘zero-marked’ see e.g. Mueller (2013: 3-5). 
 
61 
 
As mentioned in Section 2.2.3.1, the ACC marker is also used to derive adverbs from 
adjectives (see (2.19), (for Cuzco Quechua, this use of ACC is mentioned by 
Cusihuamán 1 976/2001: 120 and discussed by Calvo Pérez 1993: 253).  This 
indicates that in TK, and in some other Quechuan varieties, Acc usative marking has 
a broader range of functions than indicating the direct object relationship.  
In elicitation context and in careful speech, direct objects are always marked with the 
Accusative suffix. However, in more spontaneous speech the marker is o ften omitted. 
Preliminary observation suggests that these omissions are not associated with a given 
semantic type of verb, or properties of direct objects, including number, animacy, or 
semantic role in a given clause. Therefore, the semantic and syntactic  contexts in 
which -ta is omitted in discourse remain to be investigated in the future.  
In some Quechuan varieties, subjects are reported to occur in the Accusative if their 
semantic role corresponds to ‘experiencer’(cf. Jake 1985; Cole 1982) . This does not 
seem to be the case  in TK. I discuss the TK grammatical relations in more detail in 
Section 2.5.1. 
2.3.2.3 Inherent inflectional affixes 
Inherent inflection is ‘the kind of inflection that is not required by the syntactic 
context, although it may have syntactic re levance’ (Booij 1996: 237). In this section, 
I discuss a class of TK markers the occurrence of which is not dictated by the 
syntactic structure of clauses, but rather by the semantic  roles of their hosts (cf. 
Kroeger 2005: 103) . Unlike contextual case  marking, the inherent affixes can in 
some combinations co-occur with one another, or with the ACC suffix, on the same 
host. The following inherent inflectional affixes are attested in the TK data: 
i. Lative/Dative -ma 
ii. Ablative -manda 
iii. Instrumental/Comitative -wa 
iv. Genitive -pa 
v. Benefactive -k 
vi. Locative -pi 
vii. Causalis -raygu 
viii. Lative/Delimitative -gama 
 
62 
 
In this section, I focus on the semantic roles of nominal and pronominal phrases 
affixed with each of the inherent affixes. The grammatical relations in w hich 
constituents marked with inherent inflection can enter are discussed in Section 2.5.1. 
What requires further research in the future studies of TK is whether both contextual 
and inherent inflectional markers should be analy sed as suffixes, or enclitics. As I 
will show in Section 3.3.2.11, in the discussion of the limitative marker =lla, at least 
some contextual/inherent inflection  markers can attach  to the nominal stem both to 
the left and to the right of =lla. This is shown in (3.97) for the INSTR -wa, (3.98) for 
the LOC -pi (both in Section 3.3.2.11), and in (3.20) in for the ACC -ta (Section 
3.3.2.2). More data is needed to conclude whether the TK contextual/inflectional 
markers are described more adequately as suffixes or as clitics.  
 2.3.2.3.1 Dative/Lative -ma 
The suffix -ma occurs on indirect objects with the  semantic role of recipient, as in 
(2.27) above. It also attaches to NPs with the thematic roles of goal of movement, as 
in (2.28), or location, as in (2.29):  
  (2.28)
Pablo     ista-ma   shamu-n 
NAME  party-DAT come-3 
‘Pablo came to the party.’ 
el_310502013_1 371 
  (2.29)
Maria    chagra-ma        traba-nga    ra-w-n 
NAME   field   -DAT   work-FUT  make-PROG -3 
‘Maria will work in the field.’  
el_310502013_1 621 
In the rem ainder of thi s thesis, I gloss -ma as a Dative marker. However, the 
examples above show that the TK Dative does not only indicate location, but also the 
movement towards a location, cross -linguistically associated with the Lative case. 
This meaning of / -ma/ is similar to that of the Lative/Delimitative case -gama (see 
Section 2.3.2.3.8). 
 
63 
 
 2.3.2.3.2 Ablative -manda 
The TK Ablative occurs on NPs with the semantic roles of  the geographical start-
point of a movement, as in (2.30), or temporal start-point of an action, as in (2.31). 
  (2.30)
Kay   awa  lumamanta. 
kay  awa luma-manda

  (2.31)
Lunes-manda   tarba-ka-ni 
monday-ABL  work-PST-1 
‘I have been working since Monday.’ 
elicited 
As shown in (2.30), the TK Ablative marker can be realised with the unvoiced stop, 
as [-manta]. This is due to the influence from Unified Kichwa, where voiced  stops 
are allophones of voiceless stops, and are represented by the same graphemes (see 
Section 2.1.1.1). The Ablative also occurs on NPs w ith the thematic rol es of theme, 
as in (2.32), or reason, as in (2.33):  
  (2.32)
Juan   ambi    -manda        yacha-n 
NAME  medicine -ABL  know-3 
‘Juan knows about medicine/is an expert in medicine.’  
el_310502013_1 443 
  (2.33)

1SG      2SG-ABL  =mi   come-PST-1 
‘I came because of you.’  
el_310502013_1 364 
 
64 
 
The examples above show that the range of thematic roles marked by /-manda/ 
includes, but is not limited to , the canonical meaning of Ablative inflection,  
indicating motion away from something.  
 2.3.2.3.3 Instrumental/Comitative -wa 
The marker -wa is used in instrumental and comitative constructions, shown in (2.34) 
and (2.35), respectively.  
  (2.34)
Juan      llave-wa       pungu-ra     paska-n

now like.this P.DEM-LOC talk-PROG-ANT-1  2SG-INSTR 
‘now here I am also talking with you’  
in_25052013_2_02    050 
As shown above, when occurring on NPs with inanimate referents, -wa indicates the 
instrument used to perform an action. O n NPs with  animate referents, it indicates 
accompaniment.  
 2.3.2.3.4 Genitive -pa 
The Genitive marker -pa has three allomorphs: [ -ba] afte r nasals , [ -wa] p ost-
vocalically and after approximants , and [ -pa] in all other contexts. The Genitive 
attaches to possessors in possessive NPs: 
  (2.36)
Dios-pa  shimi   
god-GEN word  
‘the word of God’ 
attested 
Moreover, in TK possessive NPs, the Genitive is optional on nominal heads:  
 
65 
 
  (2.37)
a. [ Juan-ba  pantalon ] liki-ri-shka=mi 
 NAME-GEN trousers tear-ANTIC-ANT=mi 
 ‘Juan’s trousers have broken.’  
el_310502013_1 392 
b. [ Juan  libro=mi   ] liki-ri-shka 
 NAME book=mi       tear-ANTIC-ANT 
 ‘Juan’s book has torn.’ 
el_310502013_1 534 
The contrast between (2.36) and (2.37a) on the one hand, and (2.37 b) on the other 
shows that nominal possessors are not obligatorily marked in T K. Preliminary 
observation suggests that the (non -)occurrence of marking is not related to the type 
of possessee, the kind of possessive relationship (alienable/inalienable) or the 
animacy of the possessor. Although this issue needs further investigation, it seems 
that GEN marking on nominal possessors is optional in TK. This contrasts with the 
occurrence of the GEN on pronominal possessors – the marker never occurs on the 
1SG pronoun, but it is obligatory on 2SG and 3SG pronouns:  
  (2.38)
a. ñuka   yaya 
         1SG  father 
 ‘my father’ 
b. *ñukawa  yaya 
         ñuka-pa  yaya 
         1SG-GEN father 
  (2.39)
a. *kan  yaya 
         2SG  father 
b. kamba   yaya 
 kan-pa  yaya 
 2SG-GEN father 
         ‘your father’ 
 
66 
 
The fact that (2.38a) is grammatical and (2.38b) is not, and the converse relationship 
between (2.39a) and (2.39b) shows that  occurrence of Genitive marking is 
independent of the type of the possessee.  
 2.3.2.3.5 Benefactive -k 
The marker -k often undergoes lenition to [ -x] in rapid speech. The suffix occurs on 
NPs designating beneficiaries  in the broad sense. The BEN  marking is only 
grammatical on beneficiary NPs which function as predicates or adjuncts. Below, the 
-k-marked NP designates a beneficiary:  
  (2.40)
Kay  killka  a-n=mi  ñuka   yaya-j 
DEM letter be-3=mi 1SG  father-BEN 
‘This letter is for my father.’  
el_12092013    197  
The -k-marked NPs, can also, in some cases, be interpreted as possessors: 
  (2.41)
chi    wasi   Pedro-k=mi 
D.DEM house NAME-BEN=mi 
‘This house is Pedro’s.’ 
el_12092013    193 
The same benefactive and possessive relationships are expressed in (2.40) and (2.42) 
on the one hand, and (2.41) and (2.43) on the other. Consider: 
  (2.42)
kay   ñuka   yaya  / *yaya-j  killka 
P.DEM 1SG  father /   father-BEN  letter 
‘This my a letter to my father.’ 
elicited 
  (2.43)
chi   Pedru   / *Pedru-j  wasi=mi 
D.DEM NAME  /   NAME-BEN house=mi 
‘This is Pedro’s house.’  
el_12092013    194 
 
67 
 
The examples above suggest that the benefactive-marked NPs are ungrammatical as 
modifiers within a noun phrase , but this conclusion should be corr oborated with 
further data. When the BEN marker occurs on adjunct NPs, it can be combined with 
GEN:  
  (2.44)
aku-ychi   Klever-ba-k-ma 
go.IMP-2SG.IMP NAME-GEN-BEN-DAT 
‘Let’s go to Klever’s!’ 
attested 
At this stage  of analysis , not enough data is available  to explain the interaction 
between GEN and BEN marking. The possessive meaning shown in (2.44) can also 
arise without the GEN:   
  (2.45)
ñuka   mamita  Maria-j-ma    pasia-ngaj  ri-ka 
1SG  mommy NAME-BEN-DAT  visit-PURP go-PST 
‘My mommy went to Maria’s to visit.’  
attested 
Most of the examples above show the BEN marker occurring on phrases designating 
possessors, rather than beneficiaries. Whether the BEN -affixed NP is interpreted as 
possessor or beneficiary seems to be dependent on t he argument structure of the verb 
with which it occurs:  
  (2.46)
Pablo   wasi-ra      ra-n       Maria-k-ta  
NAME  house -ACC  make  -3  NAME-BEN-ACC 
‘Pablo makes a house for Maria.’  
el_310502013_1 245 
At this stage  of analysis , it seems justified to gloss / -k/ as a benefactive marker. 
However, more research is needed to establish its exact semantic contribution to the 
clause. 
 
68 
 
 2.3.2.3.6 Locative: -pi  
The TK Locative has three allomorphs: [-bi] after nasals , [-y] – postvocalically and 
after approximants, and [ -pi] in all o ther contexts. The Locative marking is used in 
constructions indicating location in space, as in (2.47) and time, as in (2.48):  
  (2.47)
Maria      kaspiwa     wajtan    Wandzura   wasiy. 
Maria      kaspi-wa   wajta-n  Juan -ta  wasi  -pi

The LOC can also indicate ‘metaphorical’ locations:  
  (2.49)

ima wata-ta=ga mana castellano-pi     rima-na=chu ni-ngui

‘What about the year, you say [I] should not to say [the date] in Spanish?’ 
KICHB07AGOPEDROCHIMBO1 008 
The use of -pi in (2.49) is analogous to that of the Spanis h locative preposition en 
(‘in’), but it is not clear at this stage of research whether such uses of the TK locative 
result from language contact.  
 2.3.2.3.7 Causalis: -raygu 
The Causalis is semantically similar to the Ablative manda: it can also indicate cause 
or r eason. However, it seems to be used  less frequently than the Ablative. often 
 
69 
 
occurrs in content questions, and – in collocation with a demonstrative pronoun – as 
a causal connective:  
  (2.50)

el_02102013    191 
While the Ablative suffix is used to indicate both spacial and causal relations, the 
Causalis is limited to the latter. It is also used in certain adverbial clause 
constructions (see 2.5.3.2.3).  
 2.3.2.3.8 Lative/Delimitative -gama 
The Lative is pronounced [-kama] by speakers more influenced by Unified Kichwa. 
It is used to indicate temporal or spatial boundaries:

 Verbal morphology 2.4
Verbal morphology is the feature of the grammar reported to vary the most between 
the different Quechuan dialects (Adelaar with Muysken 2004 : 209). The discussion 
in this section aims to clarify the main features of TK verbal morphology, but an 
exhaustive account of the morphological complexity of the TK verbs is beyond the 
scope of this work. Figure 2.2 illustrates the ordering of the different types of affixes 
which can attach to TK verbs in the indicative  mood. The criteria applied here to 
distinguish between derivation and inflection are the same as those presented in the 
discussion of nominal morphology in Section 2.3.

The ordering of TK  verbal affixes is not always as clear -cut as Figure 2.2 might 
suggest. For instance, subject agreement and Tense marking, placed in the same 
inflectional ‘slot’ on the diagram, can in some cases be monoexponential. 
In the sections that follow , I discuss TK derivational ( 2.4.1) and inflectional ( 2.4.2) 
morphology. The discussion of derivation includes the markers shown in Figure 2.2, 
as well as nominalising morphology . The latter is not reflected above, since it does 
not co-occur with verbal inflection. In the discussion of inflection, I first focus on the 
agreement phenomena, describing the TK subject and object agree ment marking. 
Subsequently, I discuss Tense, Aspect and Mood.  
As shown in Figure 2.1, the final sl ot is occupied by independent, ‘class free’ (cf. 
Adelaar 1977)  clitics. As mentioned previously , they attach to hosts from all 
grammatical categor ies. The se enclitics  are the main topic of this thesis, and are 
discussed from Chapter 3 onwards.   
 
71 
 
 Derivation 2.4.1
The most prominent verbal derivation processes in TK are valence -adjustment, 
Aktionsart-modification and nominalisation. Valence-adjustment alters the semantics 
of verbs, influencing the number of arguments they require  (2.4.1.1). Aktions art-
affecting suffixes are a poorly described aspect of morphology of Quechuan  
languages, and I mention them briefly below, indicating the need for further research 
(2.4.1.2). The discussion of Nominalisation ( 2.4.1.3) is limited to lexical 
nominalisation, that is, to morphological ‘processes of formin g nouns from lexical 
verbs’ (cf. Comrie & Thompson 2007). 
2.4.1.1 Valence adjustment 
Valence adjustment can be of two kinds – either decreasing, or i ncreasing the 
number of arguments required by the verb. I describe the valence -decreasing 
processes first (2.4.1.1.1), and then turn to valence-increasing suffixation (2.4.1.1.2). 
 2.4.1.1.1 Anticausative/Reflexive -ri-  
In transitive predicates, the suffix -ri- removes the agentive subject and promotes the 
patient to the subject role . It tends to occur on transitive verbs expressing actions 
‘performed without any specific instruments or methods, so that they can be thought 
of as happening spontaneously, without a (human) agent’s intervention’ (Haspelmath 
& Müller-Bardey 2005: 5). Consider: 
  (2.54)
a. [Juan    ]SUBJ  [ pantalon-da   ]DIR OBJ  liki-shka 
  NAME      trousers-ACC   rip -ANT 
 ‘Juan has ripped [the] trousers.’

  Juan-GEN trousers  rip-ANTIC-ANT=mi /    rip-ANT=mi 
 ‘Juan’s trousers have torn.’  
el_310502013_1 392 
 
72 
 
In (2.54a) liki- (‘to rip’) is a transitive verb root . Its transitivity is also shown by the 
fact that it is not grammatical in  the intransitive predicate in  (2.54a). In (2.54 b) the 
stem likiri- (‘to break’) only requires one patient-like argument . The suffix -ri- 
eliminates the agentive subject, rather than demoting it, which is the operation 
characteristic of passives (cf. Haspelmath & Müller -Bardey 2005:16) . This ‘agent 
elimination’ is shown both in (2.54) and in (2.55): 
  (2.55)

el_12092013    238 
In (2.55a), the transitive verb root riku- (‘to see’) takes two arguments: an agentive 
subject, and a direct ob ject, with the semantic role of theme . In  (2.55b), the same 
verb occurs with the ANTIC suffix, which affects the valence of the verb and  
prompts a change in its argument structure. For (2.54 b), it c ould be argued that the 
subject was acted upon by another entity, not expressed overtly . This is not the case 
in (2.55 b). The verb stem rikuri- (‘to look like’) only requires one , theme-like 
argument. The examples above show th at -ri- can be interpreted as ANTIC when 
occurring on transitive verbs. However, the data suggest that it behaves differently 
on ditransitive predicates. When occurring on a ditransitive verb, -ri- also removes 
the agent, but the derived transitive verb can have an agentive subject. Consider:  
  (2.56)
a. Pablo   paywa       warmira 
[Pablo   ]SUBJ  [pay-pa      warmi-ta      ]DIR OBJ

 ‘Pablo’s wife is delousing herself/ridding herself of lice.’  
in_21102014_01 
While (2.56) shows that -ri- is used to decrease the valence of the verb, it seems that 
the English translation fails to reflect the argument structure of the TK verb. More 
research is ne eded into the occurences of -ri- on ditransitive prediactes and the 
argument structure of the transitive predicates it derives.  
 2.4.1.1.2 Causative suffix -chi- 
The causative suffix -chi- increases the valence of the verb, adding an argument with 
the semantic role of agent/causer. Consider:  
  (2.57)
a. ñuka   liba-ka-ni  
 1SG  be.punished-PST-1 
 ‘I was punished/hit.’ 
b. Maria  Juanda  libachin. 
 Maria  Juan-ta  liba         -chi     -n 
 NAME  NAME-ACC be.punished-CAUS-3 
 ‘Maria punishes/hits Juan (lit. Maria causes Juan to be punished).’ 
elicited 
Example (2.57) is somewhat particular, since the verb root liba- ‘to be punished’ is a 
lexical passive. However, the above does show that when occurring on intransitive 
verbs, -chi- increases their valence an d expresses an immediate causal relation, 
where no third event intervenes between the cause and the effect (e.g. Fodor 1970): 
(2.57b) could not be used if Maria convinced someone else to hit Juan, rather than 
 
74 
 
doing it herself. The causative suffix can al so occur on transitive verbs to express 
immediate causation:  
  (2.58)
a. Nilo  Quito   llakta-ra  riksi-n 
NAME  NAME  town-ACC  know-3 
‘Nilo knows the city of Quito.’ 
b. Nilo  Quito    llakta-ra      pay-wa      warmi-ra          riksi-chi-w-n 
NAME NAME  town-ACC 3SG-GEN  woman-ACC    know-CAUS-PROG-3 
‘Nilo is showing Quito to his wife (lit. causing her to know Quito).’  
el_21102014_01 
The currently available  data sugges t that -chi- cannot be used to express non -
immediate causation , which is expressed in TK by means of periphrastic 
constructions, rather than verbal derivation.  
2.4.1.2 Aktionsart-affecting derivation 
In this section I discuss several suffixes that seem to affect the lexical aspect of verbs 
they attach to. These suffixes – apart from the Cislocative -mu- – have, as far as I am 
aware, not been described for other Quechuan varieties. The following affixes of this 
type have been attested in the TK data:  
i. -mu – Cislocative: when added to a verb of motion , indicates movement 
towards the speaker and/or the hearer , so in  this case, it does not affect 
Actionasart as much as the associated motion. On non-motion verbs, howerver, 
it indicates movement to a location distant from the speaker and hearer , where 
the action/state designated by the verb occurs (cf. Manley et al. 2015: 10-11). 
ii. -sta – indicates that the action is sudden and abrupt, not necessarily brought to 
completion.  
iii. -ju – indicates that the action is either repetitive, or ongoing.  
While -mu has occurred in the corpus numerous times, the other two affixes are 
extremely infrequent. Hence the scarcity of examples provided in this section.  
 
75 
 
There are several reasons to analyse these suffixes as derivational, rather than 
aspectual. Firstly, they can co-occur on the same host. Consider:  
  (2.59)
a. Upi! 
drink 
‘Drink!’ 
b. Upi-sta-y! 
drink-sta-2SG.IMP 
‘Drink quickly!’ 
c. Upi-sta-ju-y! 
drink-sta-ju-2SG.IMP 
‘Keep drinking quickly!’ (e.g. shot by shot) 
attested 
Secondly, nominalising morph ology, e.g. the agentive suffix -k (see Section 
2.4.1.3.1), attaches after them, which suggests that they are part of the stem:  
  (2.60)
Mana  apa-mu-k             a-ni,  ñuka  ña        basta       wasi     chi-wa… 
NEG take-mu-AG.NMZL  COP-1 1SG  already enough   house   D.DEM-INSTR 
‘I used not to bring [ chicha from the field ], with that  [what I had already, I had ] 
enough at home.’  
in_25052013_1_01    185 
Moreover, the suffixes described here co-occur with the Progressive aspect suffix -w, 
which confirms that they should be analysed as derivation affecting the lexical aspect 
of the verb, rather than as aspectual inflection:  
  (2.61)
rima-mu-w-n 
talk-CIS-PROG-3 
‘he passes by, talking… ’ [speaker talks about the fishseller’s tru ck. The merchant 
advertises the fish with loudspeakers as he passes by.]  
in_01082013_16   048 
 
76 
 
Example (2.61) shows the occurrence of -mu on a non -motion verb, corroborating 
the analysis of the marker proposed a bove. Much further research is needed to 
provide a complete description of this class of affixes. The aim of the remarks 
presented here was to show that they are attested in TK, and to give the reader a 
preliminary idea of their semantics.  
2.4.1.3  Lexical nominalisation 
In this section, I only discuss n ominalisation inasmuch as ‘processes of forming 
nouns from lexical verbs’ are concerned (cf. Comrie & Thompson 2007). In TK and 
other Quechuan vari eties, nominalising suffixes also play an important role in 
complex clauses, where they act as subordinators; clausal nominalisation is discussed 
in more detail in Section 2.5.3.2.  
 2.4.1.3.1 Agentive nominalisation: -k  
Agentive nominalisation is a process which derives a nominal denoting ‘one which 
verbs’ from the corresponding verb (cf. Comrie & Thompson 2007: 336). This is the 
function of the suffix discussed here. Consider:  
  (2.62)
Nestor  an       yacha-chi-k. 
NAME  COP-3  know-CAUS-AG.NMZL 
‘Nestor is a teacher [lit. the one who teaches/causes to learn].’ 
el_12092013    077 
Many de-verbal agentive nouns have become lexicalised in TK. Common examples 
of the use of this suffix are the nouns yachachik (yacha-chi-k, know -CAUSE-
AG.NMLZ), shown above, and yachak (yacha-k, know-AG.NMLZ), meaning ‘w ise 
person’. These examples also show that nominals derived with the suffix -k denote 
agents who habitually perform the action indicated by the verb  (‘teacher’), or can be 
said to be characterised by a certain state involving that verb (‘a wise man’). De-
verbal nouns created with -k are also used in present and past habitual construction s, 
discussed in more detail in Sections 2.4.2.2.1 and 2.4.2.2.2, respectively. 
 
77 
 
 2.4.1.3.2 Objective nominalisation: -y 
I understand o bjective nominalisation as morphological forming of de -verbal nouns 
designating a result, or the typical object of an action (Comrie & Thompson 2007: 
340). In TK, a morpheme that serves this function is the nominalising suffix -y. 
Compare the two examples of the use of the root iya below:  
  (2.63)
Ansawallara          ganawshas,     ñukanchi chita  
ansa-wa=lla-ta          gana-w-sha=pas         ñukanchi  chi-ta  
much-INSTR=LIM-ACC   earn-PROG-COR=ADD  1PL         D.DEM-ACC

think-ANTIC-ANT-1PL 1PL  one something 
‘Although we just earn a little, we thought this, we [to have] something…’ 
in_03072013_02   016 
 
  (2.64)
ñukanchi  llanga-na-y   chari-shka-nchi,  ama  
1PL  work-INF-LOC have-ANT-1PL PROH 
shuk  iya-y-guna-ra     chura-sha… 
one think-OBJ.NMLZ-PL-ACC  put-COR 
‘we  have [our minds busy] at work, so as not to have other ideas [alcohol/drugs]’ 
in_03072013_02    17 
In (2.63) iya- (‘to think’)  functions as the main verb, whereas in (2.64) it is 
nominalised and becom es an argument of the verb, chari- (‘to have’). Although ‘an 
idea’ is not strictly speaking ‘an object of thinking’, the definition prov ided by 
Comrie and Thompson (2007) is broad enough to all ow for this type of derivation to 
be regarded as ‘objective’ nominalisation. 
 2.4.1.3.3 Infinitive -na 
In Ecuadorian Quechua studies, the suffix / -na/ is traditionally glossed as infinitive . 
In other Quechuan dialects, including  Bolivian and Peruvian varieties, the infinitive 
 
78 
 
morpheme is /-y/. While the TK verb stems suffixed with -na preserve certain verbal 
properties, such as taking direct objects, they can also function as arguments of other 
verbs. Both these properties are shown below: 
  (2.65)
Abigail  yacha-n  killka-shka-ra    riku-na-ra 
NAME  learn-3  letter-ANT-ACC  see-INF-ACC 
‘Abigail learns to read [lit. to read that what has been written].’  
el_310502013_1 470 
In the example above, riku-na (see-INF, ‘seeing, reading’ ) - takes a (de -verbal) 
object in the Accusative case, but is itself a complement of the main verb yacha-n 
(learn-3) – the only verb in the clause inflected for person and tense (Present is zero -
marked in TK, see Section 2.4.2.2.1). Compare (2.65) with (2.55a), where riku- (‘to 
see’) is used as the main verb.  
The suffix -na is used extensively in everyday discourse. Lexical items derived with 
-na usually receive the interpretation of a state or a process, e.g. kuya-na (give-INF) 
‘the act of giving’, picha-na (sweep-3) ‘the act of sweeping’. However, object 
interpretation is also possible: miku-na (eat-INF) tends to be interpreted as ‘food’ , 
rather than ‘the act of eating’: 
  (2.66)
miku-na-ra    yanu-shka=chu ? 
eat-INF-ACC   cook-ANT=Q/NEG 
‘Did [you] cook [the/any] food?’ 
attested 
Semantic intuitions about this kind of distinction are hard to elicit, and the syntactic 
behavior of verb roots affixed with -na seems to vary across lexical items, perhaps in 
relation to how often they are used in everyday discourse and which of the two  
interpretations – the process/action or the object – is more salient in a given situation. 
The discussion above is limited to suff ixes the main function of which is deriving 
nouns from lexical verbs. Nonetheless, TK suffixes encoding Aspect or Tense values, 
 
79 
 
such as the Progressive -w and the Anterior -shka, can also be used in lexical 
nominalisations. I describe their nominalising fu nction in the discussion of relative 
clauses, to which it is more relevant than to lexical nominalisation (see Section 
2.5.3.2.1). 
 Inflection 2.4.2
This section describes TK verbal inflection. Firstly, I discuss the patterns of subje ct 
and object agreement ( 2.4.2.1). Following on from that, I discuss the morphological 
marking of Tense (2.4.2.2), Aspect (2.4.2.3) and Mood (2.4.2.4). 
2.4.2.1 Agreement  
TK agreement morphology is less complex than that of Quechuan dialects spoken in 
Peru. The ‘conservative’ Peruvian QI varieties  (cf. e.g. Adelaar 1977: 91) , and the 
QII varieties spoken in Peru and Bolivia (cf. e.g. Adelaar & Muysken 2004), exhibit 
an elaborate system of marking subject and object ag reement verbs are marked for 
four persons (Adelaar with Muysken 2004: 211; Adelaar 1977: sec.18), distinguished 
on the basis of (non -)inclusion of speaker or addressee.  TK and other Ecuadorian 
varieties (cf. Muysken 1977; Cole 1982; Jake 1985)  differ from QI  in this respect. 
TK exhibits a three -person sys tem and distinguishes two numbers: singular and 
plural. TK m ain verbs obligatorily agree with their subjects for person and number.  
Residual object agreement is also present. The TK object and subject agreement 
marking is discussed in turn below. Agreement  phenomena occurring on the clausal 
level are discussed in more detail in Section 2.5.1. 
 2.4.2.1.1 Object marking 
As mentioned above, the TK object agreement system is residual. Verbs optionally 
agree with their objects. The agreement is  only possible in case of 1SG objects, and 
is marked by means of the suffix -wa- (1SG.OBJ). Consider:  
  (2.67)
kay-manda=ga  ñuka-ra  shina   apa-wa-nun    
P.DEM-ABL=ga 1SG-ACC like.this take-1SG.OBJ-3PL 
‘from here, they took me like this….’ 
in_25052013_01   369 
 
80 
 
In (2.67), the verb agrees both with the 3PL subject, which is not overtly realised in 
the clause, and with the 1SG direct object, realised as a pronomina l phrase. 
Analogous examples in (2.68) show that the marker -wa- can only be used with 1SG 
objects, and that it is not grammatically obligatory:  
  (2.68)
a. *Kaymandaga,   kanda        / payta   /ñukanchira 
  kay-manda=ga     kan-ta      / pay-ta       /ñukanchi-ta  
  P.DEM-ABL=ga 2SG-ACC / 3SG-ACC /1PL -ACC  
shina  apawanun. 
shina       apa-wa-nun  
like.this   take-1SG.OBJ-3PL 
Intended: ‘From here, they took you/him/her/us like this.’ 
 
b. kay-manda=ga   ñuka-ra      / pay-ta       shina  apa-nun 
P.DEM-ABL=ga 1SG-ACC / 3SG-ACC    like.this take-3PL 
‘From here, the took me/him/her like this.’ 
elicited 
The only difference between the examples above is the presence of the object marker. 
Example (2.68a) shows the incompatibility of -wa with direct objects which are not 
1SG, while (2.68 b) demonstrates that the verb -object agreement is not obligatory in 
TK even when it is grammatically possible. S peakers generally judge both versions 
of 1SG object clauses grammatical . Whether the choice to use or drop the 1 SG.OBJ 
marker varies according to social factors such as age or place of origin would require 
a further sociolinguistic study.  
The suffix -wa- can function as an incorporated object pronoun. Consider:  
  (2.69)
a. Pedro=mi       uma-y    wakta-wa-ka 
 NAME =mi   head-LOC  hit-1SG.OBJ-PST 
b. Pedro=mi       ñuka-ra uma-y    wakta-wa-ka 
NAME =mi  1PRO-ACC head-LOC  hit-1SG.OBJ-PST 
 
81 
 
c. Pedro=mi  ñuka-ra uma-y  wakta-ka 
NAME=mi  1PRO-ACC head-LOC hit-PST 
‘Pedro hit me on the head.’ 
el_12092013    219 
All three examples in (2.69) are grammatical utterances of the same proposition. 
Example (2.69 a) shows that -wa- functions as an incorporated object pronoun, 
making the overt expression of the direct object unnecessary , though, as shown in   
(2.69b), not ungrammatical. As shown in (2.69 c), the direct object of the transitive 
predicate needs to be overtly expressed in the absence of object marking on the verb , 
unless understood from the discourse context. This is further confirmed in (2.70): 
  (2.70)
a. Pedro=mi         Karolina-ra      uma-y   wakta-shka. 
 NAME=mi   NAME-ACC   head-LOC hit-ANT 
 ‘Pedro hit Karolina on the head.’  
b. *Pedro=mi         uma-y   wakta-shka. 
   Pedro =mi   head-LOC hit-ANT 
el_12092013    221 
Example (2.70a) is analogous to (2.69 c). The fact that (2.70 b) is ungrammatical 
shows that in the absence of object agreement on the verb, the direct object needs to 
be expressed overtly. The difference in tense marking between (2.69) and (2.70) is 
not relevant to object marking, and is discussed in more detail in Section 2.4.2.2.3. 
In all the examples above, object marking on the verb was triggered by 1SG direct 
objects. However, 1SG indirect objects can also trigger the occurrence of -wa-:  
  (2.71)
 Ñukama    ñuka  warmira 
[Ñuka-ma ]INDIR OBJ   [ñuka  warmi-ta      ]DIR OBJ  
1SG-DAT                  1SG  woman-ACC

 1SG   father-PL   give-1SG.OBJ-3PL.ANT   be-3 
‘My parents gave me my wife.’  
el_10122014_01 
Note that although (2.71) might resemble a passive construction, the subject 
agreement on the verb shows that ‘parents’ are the subject. The 1SG argument bears 
the semantic role of recipient, and is the indirect object of the verb, but still triggers 
object agreement.  
 2.4.2.1.2 Subject marking 
In TK  and other Ecuadorian varieties , while object agreement is optional, fully 
inflected verbs must agree with their subjects  (cf. Cole 1982). In the present work, I 
regard verbs as finite if they are inflected for both subject and Tense. Nonetheless, 
this is a potentially problematic assumption, since present tense, and 3SG subjects in 
the past and anterior tenses are zero -marked in TK (see Table 2.4 below). In 
Highland Ecuadorian Quechua, subject marking in non-present tenses is conveyed by 
cumulative morphemes indicating both person and time reference (Muysken 1977). 
In the TK subject agreement paradigm, only 3PL subject agreement markers could be 
analysed as cumulative.  Table 2.4 illustrates the TK paradigm of subject and tense 
marking, on the example of the intransitive verb shamu- (‘to come’) in the indicative 
mood.

As evident from Table 2.4, the TK subject agreement paradigm exhibits certain 
idiosyncrasies, which have been marked with ‘*’ in the relevant cells.  The first 
person singular and plural, and second person singular and plural markers adhere to 
the regular pattern. The third person subject marking, both in singular and plural, 
exhibits certain alternations from the regular pattern. I discuss them in turn below.  
As for 3 SG subject marking, on verbs in present and future tense, 3SG subject 
marking is indicated by means of the suffix -n. However, in past and anterior tenses, 
3SG is zero-marked (the subject agreement suffix is marked by ∅). 
For 3PL subjects, the situation is  more complex. In the present tense, 3PL subject 
agreement is marked by the suffix -nun, which is also realised as [ -nau̯ n] by some 
speakers. The variation in the pronunciation of the suffix can also occur in the speech 
of the same speaker, and its conditioning factors remain to be investigated. The same 
 
84 
 
applies to the variation in the 3PL subject affixes in the future tense, where for 3PL 
subjects the auxiliary occurs without the progressive suffix -w.  
In the past and anterior tenses, 3PL subjects are mar ked by the suffixes -nuka and -
nushka, respectively. These two suffixes could  be analysed either as cumulative 
expression of person and tense, or be regarded as di -morphemic: -nu-ka, and -nu-
shka, where -nu could be analysed as 3PL marker. The suffix -nu also forms part of 
the other 3PL.SUBJ suffixes shown above, and occurs in other constructions 
involving 3PL subjects. Such interpretation, however, would introduce redundancy 
in the glossing of the tense -neutral 3PL marker -nun, which would have to be 
analysed as -nu-n (3PL-3). It would also alter the ordering of TK verbal suffixes; in 
all other cases subject marking precedes tense marking  (see Figure 2.2), and 
analysing -nu as a separate subject marker would introdu ce a reverse situation. 
Therefore, I choose to analyse 3PL.SUBJ markers discussed above as cumulative 
expressions of person and tense. However, the grammatical status of [ -nu] should be 
investigated in the future. 
2.4.2.2 Tense  
Morphologically, TK exhibits a four -way distinction between Past, Anterior, Present 
and Future tense. No remoteness distinctions occur in either of the tenses. As shown 
in Table 2.4 above, Present is zero -marked, while  Past, Anterior and Future are 
marked by means of dedicated affixes . In the following sections, I discu ss the 
properties of the four tenses introduced above.  
 2.4.2.2.1 Present  
TK Present tense describes situations of several aspectual types  (Bybee et al. 1994: 
140):  
i. states that obtain at the moment of speaking (S); 
ii. activities, accomplishments, semelfactives or achievements occurring 
habitually, if the habit is sustained at S; 
iii. ‘gnomic’ situations that apply to generic subjects and hold for all time (cf. 
Bybee et al. 1994: 126); 
iv. activities, accomplishments, semelfactives and achievements performed at S.  
 
 
85 
 
These situations can be expressed in TK either with the zero-marked present, or by 
the progressive marker -w (see Section 2.4.2.3.1). The examples below illustrate the 
different aspectual types of situations encoded by TK Present:  
  (2.72)
rupa-chi-n 
hot-CAUS-3 
‘It is hot.’  
el_310502013_1 006

NAME  animal-ABL  know-3 
‘Juan knows [a lot] about animals.’ 
el_310502013_1 455 
Examples (2.72) and (2.73) are examples of states that exist at the moment of 
speaking. If th e situation that holds at S is dynamic, it is expressed with the PROG 
marker -w. In the absence of progressive marking, present tense dynamic predicates 
receive a habitual interpretation:  
  (2.74)
a. Maria   Juan-da     wajta-n 
   NAME   NAME-ACC    hit    -3

‘Juan kills many animals.’ / ‘Juan is a good hunter’  
el_310502013_1 457 
 
86 
 
States that exist at the moment of speaking  (S), as well as habits sustained at S, can 
be described by two types of constructions. The first option is a verbal predicate with 
the zero -marked present, shown in (2.74 a) and (2.75). The second possibility is a 
nominal predicate, in which the agentive nominaliser -k (see Section 2.4.1.3.1) is 
used with the (often elided) copula a- ‘to be’ in the present tense: 
   (2.76)

Example (2.76) illustrates a state that exists at S, while (2.77) shows a habitual 
situation, w here the habit  is sustained at the moment of speaking. Analogous 
constructions with the copula taking the PST affix -ka describe the states that used to 
hold in the past, or past habitual situations (see Section 2.4.2.2.2).  
In addition to the above, zero-marked present is also used in gnomic sentences: 
  (2.78)

‘Dogs have tails.’  
el_21092014_01 065

Present tense is often used w ith past time reference, when the temporal reference is 
clear from the discourse context: 
  (2.79)

‘They started to build communities, a school, (they) opened a new school, well…’  
in_07062013_01    153 
In (2.79), the main verb of the first clause, kallari- (‘to begin’) is cast in the Present, 
while the main verb of the second clause: paska- (‘to open’) is affixed with the Past -
ka. Since the narrative is anchored in the past, both clauses receive a Past tense 
interpretation. A similar situation obtains for future contexts: 
  (2.80)

‘Juan, you’ll rip your trousers!’ 
el_310502013_1 388 
The utterance above uses present tense inflection, but coveys  a warning about an 
imminent future situation.  
To sum up, the zero -marked TK Present is used to  describe situations of different 
aspectual types, including states that obtain at S, habitual situations where S is 
included in the timespan of the habit, or gnomic situations. Dynamic situations 
carried out at S are described with the use of  progressive aspect marking, rather than 
by zero-marked present. Present tense can also be used to describe past and future 
situations, when the temporal reference is clear from the utterance context.  
 2.4.2.2.2 Past: -ka 
In this section, I discuss the distribution and syntactic  properties of the Past tense 
suffix -ka. I consider the suffix -nuka (3PL.PST) to be the part of the -ka paradigm 
(see Table 2.4 above). The TK Past tense describes actions that occurred prior to the 
moment of spe aking, and that have no present relevance . The PST marker -ka co-
occurs with time adverbials such as kuna ‘today’, tutamanda (‘in the morning’), kuna 
 
88 
 
chishi (‘this afternoon’), kayna (‘yesterday’), ñawpa/ñawpa ura (‘formerly/in the old 
days’). This proves that the suffix can be used to with events occurring at a specific 
point in the past . Moreover, the co -occurrence of -ka with such a range of time 
adverbials confirms that TK makes no remoteness distinctions in the Past.  
The marker -ka is compatible with different aspectual types of situations: states 
(2.81), activities  (2.82), accomplishments  (2.83), semelfactives (2.84) and 
achievements (2.85):

The fact that -ka co-occurs with different semantic classes of verbs reinforces its 
interpretation as a past tense marker . Bybee et al. (1994: 91 -2) point o ut that 
‘perfectives normally co -occur with sta tive predicates, while pasts apply to all 
predicates, having the effect of signalling past state with stative predicates’. The past 
marker distribution obtains for -ka. Examples (2.82) through (2.85) referred to past 
situations completed by S; -ka can denote states that no longer exist by S, as in (2.81) 
and (2.86), or past habitual actions, as in (2.87).

All the situations described by -ka-marked clauses seem to have no present relevance, 
as would be expected of events cast in the Past tense. Example (2.87) is of a habitual 
past construction, analogous to the habitual present discussed in Section 2.4.2.2.1. 
 
90 
 
Another distributional property of -ka which is compatible with its PST analysis is 
that it can co -occur with the Progressive -w (cf. Matthewson 2004: 377). Such co-
occurrence is not frequent in the corpus, but the two suffixes can co-occur on activity 
verbs, such as ni- (‘to say’) or kati- (‘to follow’).  
 2.4.2.2.3 Anterior: -shka 
The cogna tes of the TK -shka occur in many Quechuan varieties, and have been 
analysed differently by different authors. Adelaar (1977) and Muysken (1977) both 
analyse it as ‘sudden discovery tens e’. In Tarma Quechua (QI) , ‘sudden discovery 
tense’ denotes ‘events that have been going on unnoticed and which are suddenly 
discovered by the speaker (...)’ (Adelaar 1977: 96) . Such interpretation  links the 
‘sudden discovery te nse’ to ‘deferred realisation’ (Aikhenvald 2004: 156 -7): a 
semantic ‘extension’ of non -first-hand evidentials, im plying that the speaker 
acquired full information about an event after it had happened. Faller (2002: 30-31) 
proposes analysing the Cuzco Quechua (QII) suffix -sqa as ‘perfect of evidentiality’. 
For the same variety, Cusihuamá n (1976: 160-1) analyses it as ‘non-witnessed past’. 
For Imbabura Quechua (QII), Cole (1982: 147)  analyses -shka as denoting the 
aspectual category of  Perfect, based on the fact that it describes ‘past situ ation with 
present relevance’. In a comparative study of TAM  and evidentiality  in South 
American Indigenous Languages, Mueller (2013: chap. 4) glosses -shka as Anterior, 
on exactly the same grou nds that led Cole do label it ‘P erfect’. Mueller, after Bybee, 
defines Anterior as signaling ‘that the situation occurs prior to reference time and is 
relevant to the situation at reference time’ (Bybee 1994: 54).  
The semant ics of -shka that emerges from the TK  data suggests that it should be 
regarded as conforming with the definitions of Perfect - as used by Cole (1982), or of 
Anterior – as used in Mueller (2013). I decided to label it ‘A nterior’, which I regard 
as a much more tr ansparent label than ‘Perfect’. Furthermore, the TK data show that 
the interpretation of -shka as sudden discovery marker can not be easily rejected; it 
seems that not only the present relevance of the event is important for the use of -
shka, but also when the speaker became aware of the event: 
 
 
 
91

NAME =mi   NAME-ACC   head-LOC hit-ANT 
‘Pedro hit Karolina on the head.’  
el_12092013    221 
According to the consultant with whom I discussed these e xamples, PST is felicitous 
in (2.88), but not in (2.89). In (2.88) the speaker was affected by the beating and has 
already known for a while about the information she conveys. This is not the case in 
(2.89), where the speaker has just learnt about the event described by the proposition. 
This suggests that the use of -shka is related not only to past time reference with 
present relevance, but might have to do with how well the conveyed information has 
been assimilate d by the speake r. This is also in line with Adelaar’s (2013: 99) 
observation that in  QII dialects, the meaning of -shka can be associated with a 
mirative meaning (see Chapter 5). Therefore, we can conclude that in TK as well, -
shka is associated with past events with present relevance, which the speaker wishes  
to present as unexpected. I briefly come back to the discussion of the marker in  
Chapter 5.  
As mentioned before, -shka also plays a role in lexical and clausal nominalisation. It 
can be used to derive resultative adjectives o r deverbal nouns from verbs (cf. 
Muysken 1977: 59-65). The most common such noun used in TK is pukushka (ripen-
ANT), which means ‘ripe plantain’. The role of -shka in clausal nominalisations and 
subordinate constructions is discussed in more detail in Section 2.5.3.2.  
It is also prudent to mention that -shka can co-occur with the progressive -w:  
 
 
 
92 
 
  (2.90)
Kay   trabanaybi   parijulla   katiwshkani. 
kay  tarba-na-pi  pariju=lla  kati-w-shka-ni 
P.DEM work-INF-LOC  on.a.par=LIM  follow-PROG-ANT-1 
‘In this work, I have kept going on together [with my co-workers].’ 
in_03072013_04   011 
While this co-occurrence is most common in the clausal nominalisation use of -shka, 
as shown above, it can also occur when -shka is used with main verbs. 
 2.4.2.2.4 Future: -nga 
Future tense in TK ref ers to all events that take place after the moment of speaking 
(Bybee et al 1994: 244). As shown in Table 2.4 (see Section 2.4.2.1.2), the FUT 
marker -nga17 attaches to the main verb , which often, but not al ways co-occurs with 
the AUX a- (‘to be’), marked with the progressive suffix -w. The future tense 
constructions with and without the auxiliary are shown below:   
  (2.91)
kaya       rupa-chi-nga 
tomorrow   hot-CAUS-FUT 
‘Tomorrow [it] will be hot.’ 
el_310502013_1 020

afternoon -ACC  sun-FUT  AUX-PROG?-3 
‘[This] afternoon [it] will be sunny.’ 
el_310502013_1 014 
The marker -nga occurs in Future tense constructions, and generally marks non -
actualised events. Consider its used in the mild horatative below:  
 
 
                                                 
17 TK FUT marker -nga corresponds to the 3.FUT cumulative suffix described by Muysken (1977: 43) 
for several varieties of Ecuadorian Quechua.  
 
93 
 
  (2.93)
Kasna=mi  traba-sha  miku-na  a-nga,   churi.  
like.this=mi work-COR eat-INF AUX-FUT son 
‘Working like this, (one) should eat (feed oneself), son.’ 
in_25052013_1_01    161 
Constructions analogous to (2.93) are discussed in more detail in  Chapter 5 . In 
Section 2.5.3.2.3, I discuss purpose clauses, marked with the suffix -ngaj, which 
seems to be diachronically derived from the FUT m arker. While the different uses of 
-nga require more detailed investigation in future studies of TK, for the purpose of 
this thesis it should suffice to say that it is compatible with  all types of  future, non-
actualised events.  
2.4.2.3  Aspect 
Aspect is a grammatical category concerned with ‘internal temporal constituency of a 
situation’ (Comrie 1976: 5). TK exhibits one aspectual suffix: the progressive -w.  
 2.4.2.3.1 Progressive -w 
Progressive, as understood here, is an  aspectual category  that ‘views the action as 
ongoing at reference time’  (cf. Bybee et al.  1994). Progressive typically applies to 
dynamic, rather than stative predicates , and is use d to describe 'actions that require a 
constant input of energy to be sustained' (Bybee et al. 1994: 126). This description is 
compatible with the distribution of the TK -w. The PROG marker can co -occur with 
all TK tense markers  (see Sections 2.4.2.2). The suffix -w occurs most often on 
dynamic predicates in the present tense. In such context,  it indicates that an event is 
ongoing at the moment of speaking (see also Section 2.4.2.2.1): 
  (2.94)
shu  runa  kallpa-w-n

94 
 
  (2.95)
tamya-w-n 
rain-PROG-3 
‘It’s raining.’  
el_310502013_1 031 
Despite the  apparent incompatibility between progressive aspect and stative verbs 
(Bybee et al. 1994: 126), -w can occur on certain stative predicates. However, the 
examples below show that this is not necessarily at odds with the progressive  
interpretation of the suffix:  
  (2.96)
a. kan-da   muna-ni 
 2SG-ACC  love/want-1 
 ‘(I) love you.’ 
b. *kan-da  muna-w-ni 
   2SG-ACC love/want-PROG-1 
 Indended: ‘I love you.’ 
c. kan-wa  rima-na-ra  muna-w-ni 
 2SG-INSTR talk-INF-ACC  love/want-PROG-1 
 ‘I want to talk with you.’ / *‘I love talking to you.’ 
elicited 
The verb root muna- without the PROG suffix is ambiguous between the stative ‘to 
love’ and a more dynamic interpretation of ‘to want/ desire’. If affixed with the 
PROG, as in  (2.96b), the stative reading becomes impo ssible. It can, however, be 
used to express a momentary desire to perform a certain action, as in  (2.96c). The 
same point is illustrated below:  
  (2.97)
a. atun   yura   shaya-n  yaku  pura-ma 
 big  tree  stand-3  water side-DAT 
 ‘[A] big tree stands by the river’ 
 
95 
 
b. *atun   yura   shaya-w-n   yaku   pura-ma 
    big  tree  stand-PROG-3 water  side-DAT 
c. atun   runa   shaya-w-n   yaku  pura-ma 
 big  man  stand-PROG-3 water side-DAT 
 ‘[a] big man is standing by the river.’ 
elicited 
The contrast between (2.97b) and (2.97c) shows that PROG marker is only 
grammatical in the context in which the action requir es ‘a constant input of energy’  
and can be conceptualised as temporary. T herefore, -w is compatible with the 
definition of Progressive given above.  
2.4.2.4  Mood 
In the understanding adopted in this thesis, Mood is an expression of modality by 
means of verbal inflection. Modality, in turn, is understood as different from Tense 
and Aspect in that i t does not ‘refer directly to the characteristics of the events, but 
simply to the status of propositions’ (Palmer 2001: 1).18   
On the basis of the data analysed to date, TK finite verbs allow the following 
distinctions in terms of Mood:  
i. Indicative: used for describing factual events: events that are perceived by the 
speaker to be the part of the actual, real world. In TK, the Indicative mood is 
unmarked. It allows for a full range of Tense and Aspect distinctions;  
ii. Interrogative: used to request information. Marked by means of prosody and 
(optionally) by a range of interrogative enclitics;19  
iii. Imperative: a mood used to express commands. No Tense or Aspect  
distinction are made in the imperative. Marked by a dedicated set of verbal 
affixes; 
                                                 
18 For a sum mary of the different approaches to defining  mood and modality in the context of South 
American indigenous languages, see Mueller (2013: 131-3).  
19 Although the TK interrogative mood is not marked by means of verbal inflection, it is included here 
with other morphologically marked moods for the sake of completeness of the list of the TK modal 
distinctions. 
 
96 
 
iv. Conditional: used to express propositions the validity  of which is dependent 
on some condition. They are encoded by means of verbal inflection also used 
for subordination. 
The properties of declarative and interrogative constructions are discussed in more 
detail in Section 5.3.2, where I describe  the major clause types attested in TK. 
Although conditional constructions are attested TK, not enough data is available at 
this stage to warrant their comprehensive description. Therefore, their discussion 
here will be limited to presenting an example of a conditional clause. Consider:   
  (2.98)
kan  wasi-ma  lluta-ri-kpi[=ga],          allku  kani-nga[=mi] 
2SG house-DAT get.close-ANTIC-SWREF[=ga]     dog bite-FUT[=mi] 
‘If you come towards the house, [the] dog will bite you.’ 
el_24112014_03   371 
Example (2.98) is of a conditional expressing a possible future event and a probable 
result. The main verb occurs in the consequent, and is marked with the FUT tense 
suffix -nga, and the verb in the antecedent is unmarked for tense, and, in the case 
given above, suffixed with the ‘switch reference’ marker -kpi. The suffix -kpi is not a 
conditional marker per se, but is used in TK conditional antecedents, as well as in 
other subordinate clause types (see Section 2.5.3.2.3).  
The imperative mood is marked by means of dedicated inflectional suffixes on the 
verb. Since the markers with which this thesis is concerned do not occur in 
imperative clauses (apart from the Q/NEG =chu, see Section 3.3.2.6), it will not be 
discussed in more detail in the remainder of this thesis. Therefore, I introduce the TK 
imperative inflection below.  
 2.4.2.4.1 Imperative 
The imperative mood is used to express both positive and  negative polarity 
commands. The TK imperative inflection is presented in Table 2.5:  
 
 
97 
 
Table 2.5 TK imperative inflection 
Person Imperative suffix 
2SG -y / bare stem 
1PL (S+A) / HORT -shun 
1PL (general) / HORT -shunchi / -ychi  
2PL -ychi 
Table 2.5 shows that in the imperative mood, the subject agreement is more complex 
than in the indicative. The imperative mood distinguish es between two types of 1PL 
subjects; one only includes the speaker and the addressee to the exclusion of 
everyone else, while the other can refer to a broader group of people, including the 
speaker and the addressee. Both 1PL imperative markers receive a hortative 
interpretation in discourse. As also shown in Table 2.5, the 2SG imperative can 
either be expressed with the suffix -y, or by means of suppletive stem. Both strategies 
are illustrated in (2.99):  
  (2.99)
Shami..... ama   mandza-y=chu! 
come.IMP PROH  fear-2SG.IMP=Q/NEG 
‘Come, don’t be afraid!’ 
in_20092013_03   298 
The example above also shows that in negative polarity imperatives, the prohibitive 
particle ama is added before the verb, which, for first and second person subjects, is 
followed by the Q/NEG enclitic =chu.  
 Constituent order and basic clausal syntax  2.5
This section describes basic clausal syntax of TK. Fir stly, I discuss grammatical 
relations in the language (2.5.1). Subsequently, I analyse the syntax of simple clauses 
and their constituents ( 2.5.2). Finally, I turn to complex sentences, focusing on the 
most common morphosyntactic devices TK uses to encode subordination (2.5.3).  
 
98 
 
 Grammatical relations in TK 2.5.1
This section briefly introduces the most important characteristics of subject and 
object arguments in TK. The considerations below apply to main clauses.  
2.5.1.1 Subjects 
TK shows the Nominative-Accusative pattern of alignment (see 2.3.2.2). There is no 
syntactic distinction between subjects of transitive and intransitive clauses: all 
Subject-designating phrases, irrespective of the transitivity and the argument 
structure of the predicate, occur in the zero -marked Nominative. Subjects trigger 
person and number agreement on the verb. In unmarked constituent order, subjects 
occur clause -initially, preceding objects and the verb (Section 2.5.2.1 and 4.3). 
However, the syntactic position of the NP is not by itself a sufficient criterion for 
determining subjecthood. A common test for subjecthood is analysing the syntactic 
behaviour of the NP in passive constructions. However, this strategy is not applicable 
to TK. Sánchez (2010: 15) reports that there are no passive constructions in Cuzco 
Quechua, although certain nominalisation strategies deliver constructions which are 
similar to passives. This observation also applies to TK, where -shka (ANT) 
nominalisations resemble passives, but do not share their key characteristics of 
demoting the subject argument (see example (2.71)). Subjecthood tests involving 
control relations should be applied to TK in future research. Here, I  base some basic 
insights into the properties of the TK subject on the basis of anaphoric and cataphoric 
relations in complex clauses.  
TK subjects trigger agreement on the main verb, but (lack) of co -reference with the 
subject is also marked in certain su bordinate clause constructions. The suffix -sha is 
used if the subjects of the main and the subordinate clause are co-referential. If this is 
not the case, the subordinate verb is obligatorily marked with the suffix -kpi. The two 
suffixes are used extensively in adverbial subordinate clauses (see Section 2.5.3.2.3), 
and their use constitutes a useful initial diagnostic of TK subjecthood. Consider:  
  (2.100)
a. (Ñuka)  yarka-y-ra        chari-sha,  ashka-ra  miku-ka-ni. 
 1SG      be.hungry-OBJ.NMLZ-ACC     have-COR much-ACC eat-PST-1 
‘Being hungry, I ate a lot.’

b. *(Ñuka)  yarka-y-ra    chari-kpi,      ashka-ra  miku-ka-ni 
 1SG     be.hungry-OBJ.NMLZ-ACC  have-SWREF     much-ACC eat-PST-1 
          Intended: ‘Being hungry, I ate a lot.’  
el_10122014_01 
In (2.100a), the subordinate verb is marked with the suffix -sha, which indicates co-
reference with the subject of the main clause . The utterance is felicitous irrespective 
of whether the subject of the subordinate clause is overt. Example (2.100 b), on the 
other hand, was judged ungrammatical. The consultant suggested (2.101a) instead, 
while (2.101 b) is another example of switch -reference construction, in which the 
subject of the subordinate clasues is overt:  
  (2.101)
a. yarka-y-ra     chari-kpi,  kara-ka-ni 
 be.hungry-OBJ.NMLZ-ACC  have-SWREF feed-PST-1 
 ‘As (someone) was hungry, I fed (them).’  
el_10122014_01 
b. Manara     mikunara                 wawawna  mikukpi,

 spoon   -ACC  give -PST -1  
 ‘Before the children ate, [I] gave [them] spoons’  
el_02102013    115 
In both examples in (2.101), the main and the subordinate clause have different 
subjects, which is indicated by means of the suffix -kpi on the subordinate verb.  
Below, I use this subject agreement feature as a diagnostic to show that TK has no 
Accusative subjects. The -sha/-kpi subordinating constructions, as well as properties 
of subjects related to relativisation, are discussed in more detail in Section 2.5.3.2.  
 
100 
 
As far as the data show, TK subjects always occur in the Nominative case. This is 
not the case in other Quechuan varieties, even those closely related. Cole (1982: 107-
9) reports Accusative subjects in Imbabura Quechua (QII) spoken in the Ecuadorian 
Andes, in cases where the thematic role of the subject corresponds roughly to 
experiencer. Cole (1982: 107)  quotes two types of  constructions, involving 
‘desiderative’ or ‘lexical’  experiencers. Here, I discuss the ‘lexical experiencer’ 
construction, and compare it with similar examples from TK. According to my 
analysis, the NPs in question are not Accusative subjects, but direct objects in the 
Accusative case. Consider the following example from Imbabura: 
  Imbabura Quechua (QII) (2.102)
Juzi-ta    rupa -n 
NAME-ACC   be.hot-3 
‘José is hot.’ 
Cole (1982: 108) 
The example above  was not accepted by TK speakers. Instead, my consultants 
suggested: 
  (2.103)
a. Pigru   rupa-n  
         NAME  be.hot-3 
 ‘Pedro burnt [himself].’ 
b. Juzi-ta   rupa-chi-n 
 NAME-ACC be.hot-CAUS-3 
 ‘José is hot (lit. It makes José hot).’ 
elicited 
The TK equivalent of (2.102) is (2.103b). Below, I show that it is justified to analyse 
examples like (2.103b) as clauses with a null subject which trigger s 3rd person 
agreement, rather than as Accusative subjects (see Calvo Pérez 1993: sec. 4.1.2 for a 
similar analysis of these construction in Cuzco Quechua). Consider:  
 
 
101 
 
  (2.104)
Ñuka-ra   rupa-chi(-wa)-n 
1SG-ACC  be.hot-CAUS(-1SG.OBJ)-3 
‘I am hot (lit. It makes me hot).’ 
attested 
Example (2.104) is analogous to (2.103b), but in this case the experiencer is 1SG. In 
(2.104) it is grammatical, although optional, to use 1SG.OBJ marker -wa- (see 
Section 2.4.2.1.1). This demonstrates that in the examples above, the Accusative -
marked constituents are not subjects, but direct objects, while the subject, which 
triggers agreement on the verb, is not overt. This analysis is further confirmed by 
how construction anal ogous to those shown above function in subordinate clauses. 
Consider:  
   (2.105)
a. Ñukara  rupachikpis,    tarbakani. 
ñuka-ta   rupa-chi-kpi=pas,    tarba-ka-ni 
1SG-ACC be.hot-CAUS-SWREF=ADD work-PST-1 
‘I worked, being hot. (lit. I worked, it being hot to me).’ 
 
b. *ñuka-ra   rupa-chi-sha=s,   tarba-ka-ni 
  1SG-ACC hot-CAUS-COR=ADD         work-PST-1 
 el_10122014_01 
As discussed above, -kpi can only be used if the subjects of the main and subordinate 
clauses are not co -referential. The fact that (2.105 a) is grammatical, while (2.105 b), 
where the ‘co-reference’ suffix -sha is used, it not, shows that in TK, the Accusative-
marked experiencers have to be analysed as direct objects.  
The above discussion also shows th at in TK, the syntactic role of subject is not 
associated with one semantic role. The examples above demonstrate that TK subjects 
can have the semantic roles of agent, as in (2.100) and (2.101), patient, as in (2.103) 
or force (2.104). In the discussion of the anticausative -ri-, I show that TK subjects 
can also have the semantic role of theme (see Section 2.4.1.1.1).  
 
102 
 
In this section, I have briefly discussed the main properties of TK subjects. They 
always occur in the Nominative case and trigger subject agreement on the verb. In 
certain subordinate clause structures, the subordinate verbs need to be marked for the  
(lack of) co -reference with the subject of the main clause. The grammatical role of 
subject is not associated with one semantic role, although prototypical subjects are 
agentive. In unmarked contexts, subject NPs occur clause -initially (see Section 
2.5.2.1 and 4.3). As demonstrated in the examples above, these characteristics apply 
to both nominal and pronominal subjects.  
2.5.1.2 Objects 
This section describes the grammatica l relation of Ob ject in TK. I discuss the 
properties of both direct and indirect objects, pointing out the syntactic and semantic 
properties that allow us to distinguish them from other arguments of the verb, an d 
from each other. In the discussion above, I  have shown that both direct and indirect 
1SG objects trigger optional agreement on the verb (see Section 2.4.2.1.1). Both 
direct and indirect objects can be relativised in TK (see Section 2.5.3.2.1).  
 2.5.1.2.1 Direct objects 
TK direct objects are defined as the non -subject arguments required by a transitive 
verb, prototypically, though not obligatorily (see Section 2.3.2.2), marked by the 
Accusative suffix -ta.20 Example (2.106) below is of a simple transitive clause, where 
the subject occurs in the unmarked Nominative case, and the direct object – in the 
Accusative.   
  (2.106)
Maria   Wandzu-ra  wajta-n 
NAME  NAME-ACC hit-3 
‘Maria hits Juan.’  
el_310502013_1 118  
Only 1SG objects trigger optional agreement on the verb (see Section 2.4.2.1.1). As 
mentioned above, there is no passive construction in TK; in passive -like 
constructions, direct objects tend to precede the subject, but the y maintain their 
                                                 
20 The reasons behind this this will not be discussed here, except to say that it seems that differential 
object marking is not motivated by factors such as e.g. animacy of the referent.   
 
103 
 
grammatical role. The prototypical TK direct object is a patient, as shown in the 
example above. In the previous section, I have shown that direct objects can also 
have the semantic role of experiencer. The semantic role of recipient, howe ver, is 
reserved for indirect objects in TK. 
 2.5.1.2.2 Indirect Objects 
In TK indirect objects are not easily distinguishable from direct objects on the basis 
of the case marking they receive. As mentioned above, indirect objects tend to 
correspond to the recipient argument in ditransitive constructions. They can be 
marked either by the Dative suffix -ma or the Accusative suffix -ta: 
  (2.107)
Pablo  sisagunara  kuyan  Mariama     /   Mariara 
Pablo  sisa    -guna-ta  kuya-n  Maria-ma    /   Maria-ta 
NAME  flower-PL-ACC         give -3  NAME-DAT/ NAME-ACC 
‘Pablo gave Maria flowers.’ 
el_310502013_1 240 
In Cuzco  Quechua (QII), indirect objects can be marked with either -ta or -man 
(cognate of -ma), if the action encoded by the verb requires a transfer of a concrete 
object.21 If wh at is transferred is abstract, like an idea or knowledge, the indirect 
object can only be marked with -ta (cf. Cusihuamán 1976/2001: 145). As far as the 
data show, this observation also applies to TK. Compare (2.107) above with (2.108): 
  = (2.58b)  (2.108)
Nilo  Quito     llakta-ra      pay-wa       warmi-ra       /*warmi-ma      
NAME NAME  town-ACC  3SG-GEN   woman-ACC/*woman-DAT  
riksi-chi-w-n  
know-CAUS- PROG-3 
‘Nilo is showing the town of Quito to his wife.’  
el_21102014_01 
                                                 
21 Note that ‘concrete’ does not necessarily mean ‘material’ – Cusihuamán (1976/2001) also classifies 
‘tales’ as concrete entities.  
 
104 
 
The fact that marking the INDIR.OBJ with -ma is possible in (2.107), but not in 
(2.108) confirms Cusihuamán’s observation that only recipients of ‘concrete’ objects 
can be marked with both -ta and -ma. It also confirms that the TK -ma should mark a 
semantic, rather than grammatical role of its host.  This is not the case for -ta, which, 
when occurring on arguments of a predicate, always indicates their status as either 
direct or indirect objects.  
The TK object agreement also does not constitute a valid diagnostic for 
distinguishing between direct and indirect objects. I show in Section 2.4.2.1.1 that 
both direct and indirect 1SG objects can trigger the occurrence of the object 
agreement suffix -wa-. As mentioned above, both direct and i ndirect objects can be 
relativized in TK. Although the two types of arguments can be distinguished on the 
basis of their semantic roles in ditransitive construction, more research is needed into 
their syntactic properties in the future.  
2.5.1.3 Oblique grammatical relations  
TK oblique arguments can be identified on the basis of both their morphological 
marking and their semantic roles. As discussed in Section 2.3.2.3, TK has a range of 
inherent nominal inflectional affixes, which mark  semantic roles such as source, 
causer, instrument, beneficiary, goal or location. The inherent inflection does not 
occur on subject or object arguments. The only inherent inflectional affix which can 
occur on both term and non-term arguments is the Dative suffix -ma.  
As shown in the previous section, indirect objects can be marked with both -ta (ACC) 
and -ma. However, the DAT marker occurs not only on indirect  objects, but also on 
oblique arguments. Consider:  
   (2.109)
a. Pablo   ista-ma  shamu-n  
 NAME  party-DAT come-3 
 ‘Pablo came to the party.’ 
b. *Pablo  ista-ra  shamu-n  
   NAME party-ACC come-3 
el_310502013_1 371 
 
105 
 
The ungrammaticality of (2.109b) above shows that DAT and ACC suffixes can only 
occur interchangeably on indirect objects. It also demonstrates that rather than being 
a marker of grammatical role of indirect objects, the Dative -ma is a maker of certain 
semantic roles. In (2.109), the semantic role of the -ma-marked argument is goal. In 
(2.107) above, it is recipient. Example (2.110) shows that -ma can also mark locative 
obliques:  
  (2.110)
a. ñuka  Juan-da    yaku-ma  upi-chi-ka-ni  
1SG NAME-ACC   water-DAT drink-CAUS-PST-1 
‘I gave Juan [something to drink] by the river.’ 
b. ñuka  Juan-da  yaku-ra  upi-chi-ka-ni  
 1SG NAME-ACC water-ACC drink-CAUS-PST-1 
 ‘I gave Juan water to drink.’ 
el_10122014_01 
The semantic difference between (2.110a) and (2.110b) shows that on a non-recipient 
argument, -ma triggers an oblique interpretation, while the indirect object is 
interpreted as not expressed overtly. It remains to be investigagted whether DAT on 
locative NPs always indicates that the location refers to is the location of the object.  
To sum up, in TK oblique arguments can be identified on the basis of their 
morphological marking, as they are always suffixed with inherent inflectional affixes 
expressing case-like meanings. Only in case of the Dative -ma, additional semantic 
and syntactic factors need to be taken into account to establish whether it marks an 
indirect object or an oblique argument. 
 Basic clausal syntax 2.5.2
This section discusses the basic clausal syntax of TK. I begin by describing the word 
order of independent clauses  (2.5.2.1). Subsequently, I discuss the characteristics of 
NPs (2.5.2.2) and VPs (2.5.2.3). Pronominal and Adverbial phrases also occur in TK, 
but will not be discussed here in more detail.  
 
106 
 
2.5.2.1 Word order in main clauses 
In this section, I introduce the basic characteristics of the word order of TK. A more 
detailed discussion, including characteristics of word order in intransitive and 
transitive clauses can be found in Section 4.3, and is incorporated into the discussion 
of TK information structure.  
The constituent order of Quechuan languages, including TK, is primarily SOV. The 
ordering of constituents is relatively unco nstrained in main clauses, but is more 
strictly verb-finite in subordinate clauses. In main clauses, considerations related to 
the pragmatic structuring of propositions warrant different word orders, but orders in 
which the verb precedes the subject – VSO, VOS, and OVS  – although not judged 
ungrammatical, are considered odd. Below, I illustrate these TK word orders which 
the speakers judge as acceptable without reservations:  
  SOV (2.111)
Maria       Wandzu-ra   kaspi-wa  wajta-n. 
NAME      NAME-ACC stick-INSTR hit-3 
‘Maria hits Juan with a stick.’ 
el_310502013_1 126  
  SVO (2.112)
Maria      shindzi-ra     wajta-n    Wandzu-ra 
NAME   strong-ACC  hit-3  NAME-ACC 
‘Maria hits Juan strongly.’ 
el_23052013    156 
  OSV (2.113)
a. David-ta  Pidru   liba-chi-n 
 NAME-ACC NAME  be.punished-CAUS-3 
 ‘Pedro punishes David (lit. causes David to be punished).’  
elicited  
b. Juan-da  moto   choca-n. 
 NAME-ACC motorcycle crash.into-3 
 ‘[A] motorcycle crashed into Juan.’ 
el_23052013    181 
 
107 
 
In (2.113) I provide two examples, in o rder to illustrate that the  OS order  is not 
limited to lexical passives such as liba- (‘to be punished’). In (2.113b) the subject is 
inanimate, and the object is animate. While in elicitation the consultants would often 
produce OSV rather than SOV sentences when arguments exhibit such properties, 
animacy does not seem to be an important consideration for argument order in more 
natural discourse.  
As expected in a primarily SOV language, TK main verbs always precede  auxiliaries:  
  (2.114)
kaya       yaku   illa-nga   ra-w-n 
tomorrow  water  lack-FUT  AUX-PROG-3 
‘Tomorrow there will be no water [in the pipeline].’ 
el_12092013    115 
In nominal predicates, the predicate nominal tends to occur before the copula, but the 
reverse order is also permissible, as shown by the synonymous sentences below: 
  (2.115)
a. Pedro  yacha-chi-k   a-ka 
 NAME learn-CAUS-AG.NMZL COP-PST 
b. Pedro  a-ka   yacha-chi-k    
 NAME COP-PST  learn-CAUS-AG.NMZL  
 ‘Pedro used to be a teacher.’ 
elicited 
Adjectival predicates are more restricted in this regard, and require that the predicate 
adjective precede the copula, as in  (2.116a). The reverse order is ungrammatical, as 
in (2.116b): 
  (2.116)
a. ñuka         ñawpa   sumak   a-ka-ni 
 1SG        before  pretty   COP-PST-1 
 ‘I used to be pretty.’ 
 
108 
 
b. *Ñuka         ñawpa   a-ka-ni   sumak 
   1SG        before  COP-PST-1 pretty 
elicited 
The ordering of adjuncts is not restricted, and they can occur either to the left or to 
the right of the predicate.  
2.5.2.2 Properties of NPs 
This section describes the basic properties of TK noun phrases. In Tena Kichwa, as 
well in other documented Quechuan varieties, NPs are strictly head final. Consider:  
  (2.117)
a. [kay   sabiru    warmi-guna] 
  P.DEM  agile  woman-PL 
 ‘these clever women’ 
b. [kay   warmi-guna]       sabiru   
 P.DEM  woman -PL            agile 
 ‘These women (are) clever.’ / *’these clever women’ 
elicited 
Example (2.117a) is of an NP consisting of  a demonstrative pronoun, an adjectival 
modifier and a nominal head. The NP interpretation only arises if the nominal head 
follows all the modifiers. As shown in (2.117b), if the adjective follows the noun, the 
utterance is interpreted as an adjectival predicate, where t he subject NP consists of 
the demonstrative pronoun and the nominal head. The examples above also show that 
nominal modifiers do not agree with the head noun with respect to number (see 
Section 2.3.2.1). The same obtains for ca se: the syntactic function /semantic role of 
the NP is only marked on the head:  
  (2.118)
a. [palanda  kara-wa      ] niti-nga  ra-w-ni   kasna 
  unripe.plantain skin-INSTR press-FUT AUX-PROG-1 like.this 
 ‘I will press [it] with [the] plantain peel like this.’ 
in_20092013_01    076 
 
109 
 
b. *[palanda-wa            kara-wa      ] niti-nga      ra-w-ni   kasna 
         unripe.plantain-INST  skin-INSTR  press-FUT   AUX-PROG-1 like.this 
elicited 
In (2.118a), the syntactic function of the instrument NP i s indicated on the nominal 
head only; (2.118b), where both the dependent and the head noun were marked for 
case, was rejected as  ungrammatical. The head-final case marking on NPs and lack 
of agreement is illustrated further in (2.119): 
  (2.119)
[Kam-ba  churi-ra  ]   riku-ka-ni  [ishki  malta     runa-guna-wa   ].  
 2SG-GEN son-ACC    see-PST-1  two young   man-PL-INSTR 
[Ñuka     wawki  wasi-manda]   [Pablo-k-ma          ] ri-nuka.  
 1PRO    brother house-ABL  NAME-BEN-DAT go-3PL 
‘I saw your son with two young men. They were going from  my brother’s house to 
Pablo’s.’ 
elicited 
Example (2.119) also shows that nominal modifiers do not agree with their heads in 
case or number. It also  shows that Genitive is marked on the dependent, and is not 
obligatory. The morphology of possession in TK is much simpler than in other 
dialects, e.g. in Southern Quechua (cf. Sánchez 2010: 101 -3), which exhibits 
agreement with the person of the possessor on the possessed noun. In TK, possession 
is only marked by GEN case on the possessor, and even this marking is not 
obligatory (see Section 2.3.2.3.4). In some cases, the NPs marked with the 
Benefactive suffix -k can also  be interpreted as a marker of possession (see Section 
2.3.2.3.5).   
One of the tests that can be used to confirm that TK NPs are constituents is the 
movement test. Only entire NPs, rather than NP fragments, can be moved to a 
different position in the clause: 
 
 
 
110 
 
  (2.120)
a. [ñuka puchukay wawa ] sumak-ta tushu-n 
 1SG  last child  pretty-ACC dance-3 
 ‘My youngest child dances beautifully.’  
b. *ñuka   sumak-ta  tushu-n  puchukay  wawa 
         1SG  pretty-ACC dance-3 last       child 
c.  *ñuka puchukay sumak-ta  tushu-n  wawa 
  1SG   last pretty-ACC dance-3 child 
elicited  
In TK, the movement test allows establishing the constituency of NPs. However, in 
many Quechuan varieties, the characteristics of NPs differ from those described 
above. Some Peru vian varieties exhibit discontinuous NPs (Lefebvre & Muysken 
1988; Hastings 2003; Sánchez 2010) . In these varieties, adjectives and nouns 
belonging to the same NP can be non -adjacent, and both bear case marking (Sánchez 
2010: sec. 5.3.1) . Hastings (2003: 40-1) notes that discontinuous NPs differ in 
interpretation from their continuous counterparts; discontinuous NPs are interpreted 
as definite, while the continuous ones are ambiguous in that regard. As far as the data 
show, no discontinuous NPs are attested in TK.  
2.5.2.3 Properties of VPs 
The objective of this section is not to provide an exhaustive description of the TK VP, 
but rather to account for its basic properties. In TK, as well as in other Quechuan 
varieties, the word order within the VP is much more free than within an NP. The TK 
VPs, unlike other types of phrases, need not be head-final (cf. Cusihuamán 1976: ch. 
6; Lefebvre & Muysken 1988; Calvo Pérez 1993: ch. 6; Sánchez 2010). 
Quechuan languages are often con sidered to be discourse -configurational (cf. 
Muysken 1995, see Section 2.5.2.1). Lefebvre & Muysken (1988: sec. 2.3.3) provide 
a discussion of whether VPs exist in  Quechua, giv en the ‘remarkably free’ word 
order of Quechuan languages. T hey address claims made in the previous literature 
that Quechua is non -configurational and therefore has no syntactic VP by showing 
that the ‘apparent non -configurational characteristics [ of the P eruvian Quechua 
 
111 
 
varieties] do not preclude the presence of a VP node’ (Lefebvre & Muysken 1988: 
51). In the analysis presented in this thesis, I assume the existence of a VP in TK. A 
detailed discussion of the Quechua VP can be  found e.g. in Muysken’s (1977) 
generative study of syntactic developments within the Quechua  VP, including data 
from several varieties of Ecuadorian Quechua, spoken in the Andean provinces of 
Pichincha and Cotopaxi and the Amazonian province of Pastaza.  
In TK, again like in other Quechuan languages, the VP minimally contains a verbal 
head. In mo st cases heads of VPs are inflected verbs. However, in Quechuan 
languages nominalised verbs have syntactic and morphological properties of nouns, 
but can also retain verbal properties (Lefebvre & Muysk en 1988:  74-7), such as 
taking object complements. Consider: 
  (2.121)
Ñukanchi  [sacha    aycha-ra  miku-ka-nchi]VP ,    boda-y 
1PL      jungle   meat-ACC eat-PST-1PL          wedding-LOC 
‘At the wedding, we ate game meat.’  
elicited 
  (2.122)
[sacha   aychara  mikunara]VP   munani 
 sacha  aycha-ta miku-na-ta  muna-ni 
 jungle  meat-ACC eat-INF-ACC  want-1 
‘I want to eat game meat.’ 
elicited 
In (2.121), the VP consists of a finite verb, inflected for person, and of its direct 
object. In (2.122), the head of the VP, which functions as a complement of the modal 
verb muna- (‘want’), is an infinitive verb (see Section 2.4.1.3.3) also marked for case.  
Apart from direct objects, shown above, TK  VPs can also contain indirect objects 
and modifiers, including adverbials (and ADvPs). In their discussion of Peruvian 
Quechua, Lefebvre and Muysken (1988: 47) show that the indirect and direct object 
form a constituent with the verb. One of the types of evidence they provide is that the 
direct and indirect object can be negated together with the verb, while it is not 
possible to negate the indirect and direct object together, without also negating the 
 
112 
 
verb. Consider the TK examples below, analogous to those provided by Lefebvre and 
Muysken (1988: 48):  
  (2.123)
Ñuka   [mana   Quitu-ma  ri-ni=chu         ]VP 
1SG   NEG  Quito-ma go-1=Q/NEG 
‘I am not going to Quito.’ 
elicited 
  (2.124)
Pay   [mana   wasi-ra  riku-n=chu      ]VP 
3PRO  NEG  wasi-ACC see -3=NEG/Q 
‘He/she doesn’t see the house.’ 
elicited 
  (2.125)
a. [Mana  kan-ma  kulki-ra  ku-nga  ra-w-ni=chu                  ]VP 
  NEG 2SG-DAT money-ACC give-FUT AUX-PROG-1=Q/NEG 
 ‘I will not give you money.’ 
b. *Mana  kan-ma  kulkui-ra=chu   ku-nga  ra-w-ni 
   NEG 2SG-DAT money-ACC=Q/NEG  give-FUT AUX-PROG-1 
elicited 
In the examples above, the scope of negation is delimited by the negative particle 
mana and the NEG/Q enclitic =chu. In (2.123), negation scopes over the VP 
consisting of a verbal head and an indirect object. In (2.124), the VP contains the 
verb and the direct object. The contrast between (2.125a) and (2.125b) consists in the 
fact that in the former, the negation scopes over the entire VP containing the verbal 
head and the direct and indirect object. Example (2.125b) is ungrammatical, since the 
direct and indirect object cannot be n egated without the verb ; therefore, we can 
conclude that they do not form a constituent.22  
The VP can also be elided. Consider the example below:  
                                                 
22 In the corpus,  mana was not attested to precede objects, and negation was not attested to bracket 
simple NPs. A more detailed analysis o f the syntactic properties of negation in TK should be 
conducted in future research. 
 
113 
 
  (2.126)
[Ima-ra             ra-w-n               ]VP      warmi,  y   shina=llara        kari?

‘What is the woman doing, and also the man?’ 
el_05122014_01   004 
In (2.126), the difference between the first and second conjunct shows that the 
interrogative imara rawn (what=INT do-PROG-3) can be elided, and therefore forms 
a constituent, or, more precisely, a VP consisting of the verbal head and a 
pronominal direct object.   
The discussion in this section has  presented some arguments in favour of the 
existence of a VP in TK. The research so far suggests that TK VPs minimally consist 
of a verbal head , and that d irect and indirect objects also belong to the VP. TK VPs 
can be discontinuous . More research is needed into the TK VP in general, into the 
potential VPs in which the V and O are not adjacent in particular.  
 Syntax of complex constructions 2.5.3
This section deals with the basic syntax of bi -clausal sentences. First, I will briefly 
discuss the syntactic devices used for coordination ( 2.5.3.1). Secondly, I discuss the 
different types of subordinate constructions attested in TK (2.5.3.2).   
I understand ‘coordination’ and ‘subordination’ as defined by Haspelmath (2007). 
Coordination applies to ‘syntactic constructions in which two or more units of the 
same type are combined into a larger unit and still have the same semantic relations 
with other surrounding elements’ (Haspelmath 2007: 1) . The coordinands 23 can be 
words, phrases, subordinate clauses, or full sentences. The relation of ‘dependency’ 
occurs when these syntactic  units are conjoined asymmetrically, that is, when the 
semantic roles they play are non-identical. ‘Subordination’ is, in Haspelmath’s terms, 
‘more or less equivalent to clausal dependency’ (2007: 46). 
                                                 
23 Term used for ‘units that are combined in a coordinate construction’ (Haspelmath 2007: 50, after  
Dixon 1988).

2.5.3.1 Coordination 
In TK, syntactic units are often coordinated by conjunctions borrowed from Spanish, 
(most common of which are y ‘and’, o ‘or’), which are often combined with the TK 
particle shinallara (like.this=ID.REF, ‘also’ (see example (2.126)). TK also employs 
asydentic coordination, mainly between adjectival modifiers of the same noun, or 
nominalised verbs on the same level of syntactic structure.  
The TK additive clitic =pas functions as a coordinator of different types of syntactic 
units. It can function as an additive coordinator of two NPs in the same clause (cf. 
Sánchez 2010: 116), as well as be used for purposes of coherence, linking different 
sentences in discourse. I discuss it i n more detail in Section 3.3.2.13. A suffix which 
is used specifically for coordination of NP is -ndi, which I gloss as ‘inclusive’ (after 
Nuckolls 1993). Consider:  
  (2.127)
a. [Ñuka]   [ñuka warmi-ndi  ]      Tena-ma     ri-w-ni            /   rin-w-nchi            
 1SG  1SG   wife-INCL  NAME-DAT    go-PROG-1    /   go-PROG-1PL   
‘I am going to Tena with my wife.’/ ‘My wife and I are going to Tena.’    
b. [Ñuka ] [ñuka warmi-wa        ] Tena-ma   ri-w-ni         / *ri-w-nchi 
1SG        1SG  woman-INSTR  NAME-DAT  go-PROG-1 /  go-PROG-1PL 
‘I am going to Tena with my wife.’/ *‘My wife and I are going to Tena.’    
el_10122014_01 
The above shows that while -ndi can be used to coordinate two arguments of the verb 
which share the s ame grammatical role, this is not the case with the INSTR -wa, 
which also indicates accompaniment, but always introduces oblique arguments. For 
Cuzco Quechua, Sánchez (2010: 116) observes that the cognates of -wa and -ndi 
function as a distributive and collective co -ordinator, respectively. It remains to be 
investigated whether the same could be stated for TK.   
2.5.3.2 Subordination 
In this section, I provide examples of relative (2.5.3.2.1), complement (2.5.3.2.2) and 
adverbial (2.5.3.2.3) subordinate clauses in TK. Before proceeding to the discussion 
of those subordinate clause types, I briefly explain how the definition of 
 
115 
 
subordination mentioned in the introduction to this section informed my choice a nd 
analysis of examples from TK.  
If subordination is to be understood as occurrence of a structure in which ‘syntactic 
units are conjoined asymmetrically’ (Haspelmath 2007), the notion of ‘as ymmetry’ 
needs to be clarified. In this description, I take two clauses to be conjoined 
asymmetrically when only one of them (the matrix clause) is headed by a finite verb. 
It follows that the  verb in the dependent clause is  non-finite: not specified for tense 
(Kroeger 2005: ch.12), and not agreeing with its subject for person. In the subsequent 
discussion, I describe the different types of subordinate constructions in TK.  
 2.5.3.2.1 Relative clauses  
For the purpose of this grammatical description, a relative clause (RC) is understood 
as a subordinate clause that ‘functions as a nominal modifier’ (Keenan 1985, cited in 
Payne 1997: 325) . 24  In TK, it is possible to relativise quite a broad range of 
grammatical functions: subjects, direct objects, indirect objects, and certain types of 
obliques (see discussion below). In accorda nce with the accessibility hierarchy 
(Keenan and Comrie 1977, cited in Andrews 2007: 226), it seems that the functions 
of possessors and objects of comparison cannot be relativised.  
Below, I discuss the morphosyntactic s trategies used to relativise different types of 
arguments in TK. For each type of relative clause, I discuss (i) the structural 
relationships between the RC and the NPmat, (ii) the recoverability strategy, and (iii) 
morphosyntactic devices used in the proc ess of relativisation and the position of the 
RC in the clause (cf. Andrews 2007: 207). After analysing the different types of RCs, 
I conclude the section with a short summary of properties of relative clause 
constructions in TK.  
i. NPmat is the subject of the RC 
First, let us consider examples of restrictive relative clauses, where the head of the 
RC is the SUBJ of both the matrix clause and the RC: 
                                                 
24 Note that this definition includes ‘non -restrictive’ clauses, which do not help specify the referent of 
the domain nominal, but provide additional information about that nominal. Such clauses fall outside 
the definition of RC provided e.g. by Andrews (2007: 206) , who understands RCs as subordinate 
clauses ‘which delimit the reference of an NP by specifying the role of the referent of that NP in the 
situation described by the RC’.

D.DEM  house -LOC   live  -3 
‘The foreign woman who came from Poland lives in that house.’  
el_25102013    106 
In all the above examples, the head of the RC is the subject of both the RC and the 
matrix clause. In all cases, the RC is clause -initial, and precedes the nominal it 
modifies. That is, it takes the same position  as modifiers of the head noun within an 
NP (see Section 2.5.2.2). 
 
117 
 
The RCs above are all externally headed, and the relativised argumen t is omitted in 
the RC (‘gap’ strategy). All the RCs are nominalised using the same strategy, that is, 
the verb stem is affixed with the agentive nominaliser -k. In RCs, the agentive 
nominaliser can be used interchangeably with the progressive suffix -w, at least when 
the nominalised verb describes a punctual action, rather than habitual action or a 
state. The example below demonstrates this:  
  restrictive, NPrel SUBJ, NPmat DIR.OBJ (2.132)
[chi       shaya-w          /shaya-k                ]RC      runa-ra               muna-ni. 
 D.DEM  stand-PROG /  stand-AG.NMLZ      person-ACC  love   -1 
‘[I] love [the] man [who] stands/is standing there.’    
el_25102013    039 
In (2.132), the head of the RC is the direct object of the matrix clause. This, however, 
does not have any implications for the morphosyntactic properties of the relative 
clause, which are the same as in the previous examples. So far, the examples in this 
section were only of externally headed RCs, but (2.133) shows that headless RCs are 
also a possibility: 
  restrictive, NPrel SUBJ, NPmat SUBJ (2.133)
[chi      -ma     shaya-k               /shaya-w       ]RC yaya    tuku-sha           puri-w-n 
 D.DEM -DAT stand-AG.NMLZ/stand-PROG      father  become-COR   go-PROG-3 
‘The one standing there goes around all sorted out (lit. made a father).’ 
el_25102013    101 
In (2.133) the position of the RC and the relativizing morphology are the same as in 
(2.128) through (2.131), but there is no domain nominal that the RC modifies. Rather, 
the nominalised verb is referential. Note that the noun ‘father’ forms a part of an 
idiomatic expression yaya tukusha (meaning roughly ‘to be all sorte d out’, Spanish: 
hecho el bueno), and does not belong to the RC.  
The examples above were of restrictive RCs. As shown below , non -restrictive 
subject RCs also occur in TK:  
 
 
 
118 
 
  non-restrictive, NPrel SUBJ, NPmat SUBJ (2.134)

‘Jacobo, who just came, is a good man.’  
el_25102013    110 
In the above, the relativisation strategy is the same as in (2.128) though (2.131): the 
nominaliser -k on the subordinate verb. However, while restrictive RCs  occur pre-
nominally, non-restrictive clauses immediately follow the head of the NP they 
modify.  
In both (2.134) and (2.135), there is a prosodic break between the proper name and 
the rest of the clause, and the pitch goes down markedly at the end of the RC, unlike 
in the restrictive clause s. More examples would be needed to provide conclusive 
evidence, but the data suggests that despite using the same subordinate verb form and 
recoverability strategy, restrictive and non-restrictive subject RCs differ substantially 
in how they are syntactic ally integrated with the matrix clause (cf. Andrews 2007: 
207).   
To sum up, subject RCs in TK can be either restrictive or non -restrictive. Restrictive 
RCs occur in the pre -nominal position which is also normally taken b y adjectival 
modifiers. They can be externally headed or headless, and are nominalised by the 
agentive nominaliser -k or the progressive suffix -w, depending on the type of 
situation described by the RC. The syntactic function of the domain nominal within 
the matrix clause is irrelevant to the properties of the RC. Non -restrictive RCs make 
use of the same nominalising morphology, but occur to the right of the nominal the y 
 
119 
 
modify. Their prosody suggest s that they are less integrated with the matrix clause 
that their restrictive counterparts.  
ii. NPmat is the direct object of the RC 
Below, I show that TK direct objects can be relativised. The nominal modified by the 
RC is the subject of the matrix clause. Firstly, I discuss restrictive RCs of that kind:  
  restrictive, NPrel DIR.OBJ, NPmat SUBJ (2.136)
[kan  riku-shka  ]RC   runa            ñuka   wawki  =mi 
 2SG  see -ANT     person   1SG  brother.of.male=mi 
‘The man you saw is/was my brother.’ 
el_25102013    138 
  restrictive, NPrel DIR.OBJ, NPmat SUBJ (2.137)
[kan  miku  -w  -shka  ]RC   muyu    pakay =mi 
 2SG  eat-PROG-ANT     fruit    guava =mi 
‘The fruit you’ve eaten was guava.’ 
el_25102013    140 
The above examples show that also DIR.OBJ restrictive RCs occur clause -initially, 
in the position typical for modifiers , and are externally headed. The verbs in RCs are 
not inflected for tense, but receive the anterior suffix -shka. Affixing verbs with  
-shka is a common strategy of resultative nominalisation . As shown by example 
(2.137), when the situations described by matrix and relative clause are simultaneous, 
the nominalised verb can in addition be affixed with the progressive suffix -w.  
Since the relativised relation is that of DIR.OBJ, the subject of the RC occurs within 
it, clause-initially. The relativised grammatical relation is gapped, like in subject RCs. 
The subject of the RC can also be omitted when it is known to both speech act 
participants, as in (2.139) below. When overt, it stan ds in the regular subject case 
(Nominative), as in (2.138):  
  restrictive, NPrel DIR.OBJ, NPmat SUBJ (2.138)
[Jacobo       riku-shka ]RC    runa-wna         feria-ma=mi        ri-nushka. 
 NAME       see  -ANT        person -PL       market-DAT=mi go -3PL.ANT 
‘The people Jacobo saw have gone to [the] market.’  
el_25102013    122

  restrictive, NPrel DIR.OBJ, NPmat SUBJ (2.139)
[Ñankarta   riku-shka ]RC   runa-wna  Tena-ma      ri-nuka. 
 recently see  -ANT   person-PL NAME-DAT go-3PL.PST 
‘The people we just saw were going to Tena.’ 
el_25102013    118 
Examples (2.138) and (2.139) use the same relativisation strategy, but the matrix 
clauses differ in their choice of the finite verb form. In (2.136) the copula verb a- 
(‘be’) is also omitted, a construction often used with predicative nominals, especially 
when they are suffixed with a discourse marker, e.g. an evidential.  
In subject RCs, the role of the domain nominal in the matrix clause was irrelevant to 
the form of the RC. It is also the case for direct object RCs. Compare  (2.140) and 
(2.141) below: 
  restrictive, NPrel DIR.OBJ, NPmat SUBJ (2.140)
[Nilo    kuya-shka        ]RC palanda-wna          gustu  miku-na=mi             a-ka 
 NAME give.a.gift-ANT      unripe.plantain-PL good  eat-AC.NMLZ =mi COP -PST 
‘The plantains Nilo gave me were a tasty food.’ 
el_25102013    129 
  restrictive, NPrel DIR.OBJ, NPmat DIR.OBJ (2.141)
[Nilo      kuya-shka         ]RC  palanda-ra              ukta=lla  miku-ka-ni. 
 NAME   give.a.gift-ANT    unripe.plantain-ACC  quick=LIM eat   -PST-1 
‘The plantain Nilo gave me, I ate (them) very fast.’  
el_25102013    127 
In (2.140), the head of the RC is the subject, and in  (2.141) - the direct object of the 
matrix clause. The change in grammatical relation to the matrix clause is evidenced 
by case marking on the head noun, which occurs in the Nominative in (2.140), and in 
the Accusative in (2.141).  
All the above observations apply to restrictive RCs. The properties of non -restrictive 
relative clause constructions are quite different. Consider:  
 
 
121 
 
  non-restrictive, NPrel DIR.OBJ, NPmat SUBJ (2.142)
ñuka   hermano     [Wilma  pay    riku-shka]RC    profesor=mi   a-n 
1SG   brother        NAME  3SG   see  -ANT  teacher=mi COP-3 
‘My brother, whom Wilma saw, is a teacher.’  
el_25102013    134 
  non- restrictive, NPrel DIR.OBJ, NPmat SUBJ (2.143)
[ñuka  hermano -ra  kan   riku -shka]RC   profesor=mi    a -n 
 1SG  brother-ACC  2SG     see  -ANT    teacher=mi          COP -3 
‘My brother, whom you have seen,  is teacher.’  
el_25102013    132 
The RC in (2.143) is functionally similar to that in (2.142), but the syntactic structure 
of the example is quite different. Example (2.142) is externally-headed, as opposed 
to the internally-headed (2.143). The recoverability strategies also differ. Instead of a 
gap, as in all the other cases, in (2.142) we find a third person resumptive pronoun  
pay. Normally, pronouns in the  DIR.OBJ function occur in the Accusative, but here 
the pronoun is unmarked for case. As mentioned above, in (2.143), the RC is headed 
internally. The head nominal occurs clause initially, in the default subject position (it 
is the subject of the matrix clause), but is marked with the ACC case, which indicates 
its relativised grammatical relation of DIR.OBJ.  
To sum up, restrictive RCs that relativise direct object s are externally headed. They 
occur within the NP they modify, in  the position normally occupied by an adjectival 
modifier. Unless its identity is clear from the discourse context, the subject of the RC 
occurs clause-initially, and the relativised grammatical relation is omitted from the 
RC (‘gap’ strategy). Direct object restrictive RCs are tenseless. The subordinate verb 
form is partially nominalised by means of affixing the anterior marker -shka, which 
can be preceded by the progressive marker, depending on the temporal relations that 
hold between the RC and the matrix clause.  
The data collected so far shows that non-restrictive direct object RCs either occur to 
the right of the nominal they modify (NP external), or are internally headed. They 
have an overt subject, and the relativised grammatical relation is marked b y either a 
resumptive pronoun, unmarked for case (externally headed RC), or by the ACC case 
 
122 
 
affix on the head nominal (internally headed RCs). Functional motivation of each of 
these constructions requires further study into the properties of RCs in TK.  
iii. NPmat is the indirect object of the RC 
On the basis of the data collected to date, it is plausible to say that the indirect object 
RCs are similar to the direct object relativising constructions. Consider (2.144) below, 
illustrating a restrictive indirect object RC:  
  restrictive, NPrel INDIR.OBJ, NPmat SUBJ (2.144)
[Jacobo   pakay-ra     ku-w-shka        ]RC  ushushi         ña      ri-ka=mi 
 NAME  guava -ACC give -PROG-ANT   daughter       already  go-PST =mi 
‘The girl to whom Jacobo have the guava had already left.’ 
el_25102013    165  
The RC is clause-initial, externally headed, and occurs in the position of an adjectival 
modifier. The relativised argument is omitted, but the subject and direct object of the 
relative clause are both re alised. The verb is affixed with the anterior suffix -shka, 
which also occurs in direct object RCs.  
iv. NPmat is an oblique of the RC 
The data collected so far is not sufficient to conclude what types of oblique 
arguments can be relativised. Examples below il lustrate relativisation of location 
(2.145) and purpose (2.146):  
 non-restrictive, NPrel LOC, NPmat PRED (2.145)
kay        wasi  =mi      [ñuka  kawsa -w    -shka ]RC 
P.DEM  house =mi   1SG  live  -PROG-ANT   
‘This house  is where I live.’ 
el_12092013    224 
  non-restrictive, NPrel PURP NPmat  PRED (2.146)
kay=mi   [lumu     taka-w-shka                       ]RC  batan         
P.DEM=mi   manioc    squash-PROG-ANT wooden.recipient         
‘This is a batan (wooden recipient) to crush manioc.’ 
el_12092013    234 
 
123 
 
Morphosyntactically, these RCs are similar to relativised object  and indirect object 
constructions. In both (2.145) and (2.146) head nominals function p redicatively, so 
they are not easily compared with previous examples.  
 2.5.3.2.2 Complement clauses 
The examples below show the properties of complement clauses in TK, for 
complements of the verb yacha- (‘know’/‘learn’). Consider:  
   (2.147)
Abigail  yacha-n  [killka-na-ra                ]CP 
NAME  learn-3  letter-AG.NMLZ-ACC 
‘Abigail knows how to to write.’ 
el_23052013    318 
  (2.148)
Abigail    yacha-w-n       [killka-shka-ra    riku-na-ra                   ]CP 
NAME     learn-PROG-3   letter-ANT-ACC  see-AC.NMLZ-ACC 
‘Abigail is learning to read [lit. to read  that what has been written].’ 
el_310502013_1 470 
The examples above show that the complement of ‘learn’ can be a a complement 
clause headed by a nominalised verb , consisting minimally only of a  nominalised 
verb, as in  (2.147). The complements of ‘learn’/‘know’ are always marked by the 
INF nominaliser -na (see Section  2.4.1.3.3). The use of -na is a common 
complementation strategy, used e.g. with verbs of k nowing or perception, or with 
muna- (‘want’). In  Chapter 5 , I discuss the complements of speech, which are 
relevant for the description of the properties of the free enclitic =mi (see Chapter 3 
onwards).  
 2.5.3.2.3 Adverbial clauses 
In this section, I discuss adverbial clauses, that is, clauses that serve as ‘modifiers of 
verb phrases or entire clauses’ (Thompson, Longacre & Hwang 2007: 238) . 
Adverbial modification of the matrix clause is ach ieved by means of a special verb 
form, whic h, in certain types of clauses, is additionally accompanied by a 
 
124 
 
subordinating adverbial. Below, I list and discuss the different types of adverbial 
clauses occurring in TK. 
This classification of TK adverbial clauses is based both on semantic criteria, 
following the classifications presented by Hengevald (1991) and Thompson et al. 
(2007), and on the morphosyntactic strategies used to express adverbial modification 
of the matrix clause.  
Examples below show that adverbial clauses do not have a fixed position with 
respect to the matrix clause.  Although more research is needed to instantiate this 
claim, I h ypothesise that in TK, the position of an adverbial clause is often 
‘determined by its role in linking the main clause which it modifies to the preceding 
discourse’(Thompson et al. 2007: 240).  
When overt, arguments in subordinate clauses are marked in the same way as in main 
clauses – subjects occur in the zero -marked Nominative, and direct objects are 
marked with the Accusative -ta. In several types of adverbial clauses, the (lack of) 
co-reference of the subject of the matrix clause and the subordinate clause is 
obligatorily marked on the subordinate verb – the suffixes used to mark this (lack of) 
co-reference are -sha (co-reference) and -kpi (switch reference ), which were 
introduced in Section 2.5.1.1.  
i. Simultaneity  
Simultaneity clauses describe even ts taking place simultaneously with those in the 
main clause. The subordinate verb form is non-finite:

Examples in (2.149) show that when the subjects of the main and subordinate clauses 
are not co -referential, two non -finite constructions can be used. The ANT+LOC 
nominalisation strategy shown in (2.149a) can also be used when the subjects of both 
clauses are co-referential, as in (2.150). The second strategy , shown in (2.149 b), can 
only be used where the subject of the main clause is different from that of the 
subordinate clause. The example below is of a complex sentence in which the subject 
of the main and subordinate clause is the same:  
  (2.150)
escuela -ma    shamu -shka -y  Guillermo-ta    riku -ka  -ni 
school  -DAT   come  -ANT-LOC   NAME -ACC   see  -PST -1 
‘When I came to school, I saw Guillermo.’ 
el_02102013    103 
Given the semantics of the verbs used in the examples above , it could be argued that 
the situation described by the main clause follows the subordinate clause situation.  I 
discuss the anteriority clauses in  the following section, showing that a different 
subordination strategy is used if the speaker intends to convey that the two events in 
the clause are not simultaneous.  
ii. Anteriority  
In the anteriority constructions, the subordinate claus e event takes plac e before the 
main clause event. The subordinate verb is marked by the anterior/resultative suffix  
-shka. A temporal adverbial washa follows the subordinate verb. 
  (2.151)
Miku-shka     washa,    plato-ra      maylla-ka-ni 
eat   -ANT   after      plate -ACC   wash  -PST -1 
‘After eating/having eaten, I washed the dishes.’ 
el_02102013    105

Wawa-wna       miku-shka     washa,    plato-ra  maylla-ka-ni. 
child  -PL     eat   -ANT   after      plate -ACC wash   -PST -1 
‘After the children ate, I washed the dishes.’ 
el_02102013    107 
 
126 
 
Examples above show that in anteriority clauses, similarly to simultaneity clauses,  
the same subordination strategy involving -shka (ANT/resultative) can be  used 
irrespective of whether the subject of the main and subordinate clause are  co-
referential. However  – again, similarly to simultaneity clauses  – a different 
construction, explicitely indicating switch reference, can only be used if the subject 
of the main and subordinate clause is not the same. Consider: 
  (2.153)
a. wawa-wna       miku-kpi,      plato-ra  maylla-ka-ni. 
 child  -PL    eat   -SWREF    plate -ACC wash   -PST -1 
 ‘After the children ate, I washed the dishes.’ 
b. *wawa-wna       miku-kpi     washa,   plato-ra  maylla -ka  -ni 
     child  -PL    eat    -SWREF  after     plate -ACC wash   -PST -1 
elicited 
Consultants evaluated (2.153 a) as equivalent to (2.152), despite the fact that it does 
not make it explicit that one action followed the other, and in that resembles the DS 
simultaneity clause discussed above.  Interestingly, a combination of the DS suffix -
kpi with the temporal adverbial washa (‘after’) was judged ungrammatical. More in -
depth research is needed, however, to account for this co-occurrence restriction.  
iii. Posteriority clauses 
Posteriority clauses describe events that happened after those of the main clause. In 
these constructions, t he time adverbial manara always precedes the subordinate 
clause. 25 Consider:  
  (2.154)
Manara     mikunga     rawsha,                  makira     mayllarikani. 
mana -ta  miku-nga   ra -w -sha              maki -ta   maylla-ri        -ka  -ni 
NEG  -ACC  eat   -FUT  AUX-PROG-COR hand -ACC   wash -ANTIC-PST-1 
‘Before cooking, I washed my hands.’  
el_02102013    109 
                                                 
25 On the basis of the TK data, it could be concluded that t he adverbial manara is derived from the 
negation particle mana affixed with the ACC suffix -ta, in a process is analogous to the formation of 
adverbs, mentioned in Section 2.3.2.2. However, it is also possible that manara is historically derived 
from mana suffixed with -raq ‘still’ (Rosaleen Howard, p.c, 23.09.2016). The suffix -raq did not 
occur in the TK data, but is attested e.g. in Huánuco Quechua (Weber 1989:510, cf. Section 3.3.2.12).

 ‘Before the children ate, I gave spoons (to the children).’  
el_02102013    115 
The examples above show that  in posteriority clauses, like in the other adverbial 
clause types described above, switch-reference constructions can be expressed by 
two types of structures. The first one, shown in  (2.155a), is analogous to the 
posteriority construction  where the subjects of both clau ses are co -referential. The 
second one, (2.155b), can only be used in switch-reference constructions. 
iv. Cause 
This type of adverbial clause  ‘describes the (non-intentional) event causing the main 
clause event’ (Hengeveld 1991:15). Consider:  
  (2.156)
manga  rupa -shka,   nina -y    chura-kpi 
pot    hot   -ANT    fire  -LOC  put -SWREF 
‘The pot burned because (someone) put it in the fire.’  
el_02102013    124 
 
128 
 
In (2.156), the suffix -shka functions as the main verb tense marker, indicating a past 
event with present relevance. The subordinate verb is affixed with the suffix -kpi, 
indicating switch -reference. The subject of the subordinate clause, although not 
specified, is different from that of the main clause. In (2.157), the subject of the main 
and subordinate clause is the same:  
  (2.157)
yura    ña       mana  bali-n,   tamya-y    uku     -sha 
wood   already  NEG   be.good -3  rain   -LOC  get.wet-COR 
‘[The] wood is no good anymore, having gotten wet in the rain.’ 
el_02102013    127 
The examples above show, that in case of cause adverbial clauses, it is only the 
same/different subject reference that is indicated on the subordinate verb, while the 
causal interpretation arises by virtue of the meaning of the conjoined clauses. A 
similar situation obtains also for manner/means clauses, discussed below.  
v. Manner/Means 
Manner clauses ‘describe the way the main clause event is executed’, while means 
clauses specify ‘the means by whic h the main clause event is achieved’  (Hengeveld 
1991). The fact that these types of clauses describe manner or means by which the  
main action was executed, implies  that both the main and subordinate clause occur 
simultaneously and have the same subject. In line with this observ ation, TK means 
and manner clauses use the co-reference suffix -sha on the subordinate verb:  
  (2.158)
wawa -guna   kapari -sha   shamu -nuka 
child  -PL     shout  -COR     come  -3PL.PST 
‘The children came, shouting.’ 
el_02102013    122 
  (2.159)
Jorge      [taku        -ra    /-wa        shita-sha]  ashka   aychawa-ra  wan-chi-ka. 
NAME     dynamite-ACC/-INSTR hit -COR  much   fish  -ACC  die -CAUS-PST 
‘Jorge killed a lot of fish hitting (them) with dynamite.’ 
el_02102013    189 
 
129 
 
There is an important difference between the  two sentences shown above. In the 
manner clause in (2.158), the subordinate verb functions in a manner akin to an 
adverbial modifier. In the means clause in (2.159), the subordinate verb takes an 
oblique/direct object argument, indicating the object by means of which the action of 
the main verb was performed. The argument occurring in the subordinate clause can 
either be marked with ACC, as the DIR.OBJ of the subordinate verb, or with INSTR, 
as the instrument of the main verb. The properties of arguments which allow such 
marking require further investigation.  
vi. Purpose 
Purpose clauses in TK seem to encompass  both ‘purpose’ and ‘reason’  clauses as 
defined by Thompson et al. (2007). According to their definition , ‘purpose clauses 
express a motivating event which must be unrealised at the time of the main event, 
while reason clauses express a motivating event which may be realised at the time of 
the main clause event’ (Thompson et al. 2007: 250-1). As far as the data show, this  
realised/unrealised distinction is irrelevant to TK.  
In purpose clauses, se veral different subordination strategies are possible.  Example 
(2.160) is of a complex clause in which subject s of both clauses are co -referential. 
The subordinate verb can be suffixed with the future mark er -nga, followed 
immediately by the purpose suffix -wa, as in  (2.160a), or suffixed only with the 
purpose marker -ngaj (possibly derived from the FUT marker -nga), as in (2.160b): 
  (2.160)
a. kay         botas -ta   randi -ka-ni  sacha  -ma  puri   -nga   -wa  
 P.DEM    shoes-ACC  buy-PST-1   jungle -DAT walk -FUT  -PURP   
b. kay       botas-ta     randi-ka-ni      sacha-ma  puri-ngaj 
 P.DEM  shoes-ACC  buy-PST-1   jungle -DAT go-PURP   
 ‘I bought these boots to walk in the jungle.’ 
 el_02102013    187 
Unlike in other types of subordinate clauses described in this section, the same 
subordination strategies can be used if the subjects of the main and the subordinate 
clause are not co-referential. Consider:  
 
130 
 
  (2.161)
a. Kay       awio-ra              apa-mu-ni          kan    kama-nga-wa 
 P.DEM  avio.fruit-ACC    take-CIS-1   2SG    try   -FUT-PURP 
b. Kay       awio-ra        apa -mu-ni   kan  kama -ngaj 
P.DEM  avio.fruit-ACC    take-CIS-1   2SG  try    -PURP 
 ‘I brought you this avío fruit so that you try.’ 
el_02102013    185 
As far as the data show, the two strategies shown above can be used interchangeably.  
vii. Reason 
Reason clauses ‘describe a consideration that led a main clause participant to engage 
in the main clause event’  (Hengeveld 1991:15). The subordination strategy used in 
TK reason clauses is the use of the co-reference/switch reference marking suffixes. 
Consider:  
  (2.162)
a. Pablo   miku -n   yarka  -y           -ra    chari-sha   
 NAME  eat     -3 hunger -OBJ.NMLZ -ACC   have-COR 
 ‘Pablo eats because he is hungry (lit. having hunger).’ 
el_310502013_1 348 
b. Pablo  miku -n  yarka   -chi         -kpi 
 NAME  eat    -3   hunger  -CAUS  -SWREF 
 ‘Pablo eats because he is hungry (lt. because hunger causes him [to]).’ 
el_310502013_1 343 
In (2.162a), Pablo is the subject of both the main and subordinate verb – he is eating, 
and he ‘has hunger’ . In (2.162b), the ‘switch reference’ suffix -kpi is used together 
with the causative suffix -chi, indicating that in the adverbial clause, Pablo is not the 
subject of being hungry, but rather, hunger is caused to him – hence, the matrix and 
subordinate clause have different subjects . As in case of manner/means and cause 
clauses discussed above, it s eems that in reason clauses, the reason interpretation 
arises by virtue of the semantic content of the clause, rather than a specific 
construction type.

 Morphosyntax and basic semantics of  Chapter 3
   free enclitics:  delimiting the class of TK 
   discourse markers  
Tena Kichwa, like other Quechua varieties, has a class of markers which  attach to 
hosts from different grammatical categories, and the meaning of which is related to 
pragmatic structuring of discourse rather than to its truth -conditional content . In 
previous literature on Quechuan, expressions encoding discourse -related and 
epistemic meanings, including the evidential markers, have been consistently 
analysed as enclitics (cf. e.g. Parker 1969; Weber 1986; Faller 2002; Adelaar with 
Muysken 2004). In this chapter, I describe the morphosyntax and basic semantics of 
the TK ‘free enclitics’, with the following objectives: (1) to determine whether they 
can be analysed as enclitics, (2) to verify whether they form a  morphosyntactic 
system26 and (3) to establish whether it is accurate to describe them as discourse 
markers. 
The chapter is divided into four parts. Firstly, I define the notion of ‘discourse 
markers’ (3.1). Secondly, I discuss the cross -linguistic properties of (discourse) 
clitics, and provide a list of language-specific criteria to distinguish clitics from other 
types of bound morphemes in TK ( 3.2). Thirdly, I list the enclitics attested in the TK 
corpus and describe their basic morphosyntactic and syntactic properties  (3.3).  
Finally, I bring together the definitions and the data, proposing that a class of TK 
discourse enclitics does exist, but that it does not include all markers which can be 
classified as enclitics on morphosyntactic grounds (3.4).  
 Discourse markers in TK: towards a definition 3.1
Discourse markers were initially defined as ‘sequentia lly dependent elements that 
bracket units of talk’  (Schiffrin 1987: 31) , used to increase discourse coherence.  
While the term was introduced by Schiffrin (1987), interest in studying expressions 
enhancing text cohesion goes back to the seminal work of Halliday and Hasan (1976).  
                                                 
26 Understood as ‘a distributionally coherent set of linguistic expressions’ (Boye 2012: 48). 
 
132 
 
Schiffrin (1987) focused on utterance -initial, non -obligatory linguistic expressions, 
which both increase text coherence and have other functions in discourse, but she did 
not delimit a specific class of expressions. For Fraser (e.g. 1990; 1996; 2009)  
‘discourse markers’ were a subtype of what he  calls ‘pragmatic markers’ – markers 
which have ‘pragmatic’ meaning, distinct from ‘content’ meaning. His content  vs. 
pragmatic distinction is akin to the relevance -theoretic division between explicature 
and implicature, where explicature results from deve loping the logical form of the 
utterance, and implicature is a combination of explicatures and contextual 
assumptions (cf. e.g. Sperber & Wilson 1995). Fraser divides pragmatic markers into 
several classes, treating Schiffrin’s (1987) ‘discourse markers’ as a subclass of 
‘commentary pragmatic markers’, signalling how the current utt erance relates to 
prior discourse (Fraser 1990). 
Fraser’s approach equates ‘discourse markers’ with ‘discourse connectives’, i.e. 
expressions used to link units of discourse. More recent research shows, however, 
that discourse connectives are perhap s the best-described, but just one of the classes 
of discourse markers (Pons Bordería 2001:  226-9). Discourse connectives always 
connect two different discourse objects, be it events,  states or propositions (Asher 
1993, cited in Zufferey & Degand 2013:1)  – they include expressions such as and, 
then, but. Discourse markers, on the other hand, scope over only one discourse object 
(Zufferey & Degand 2013: 1). They include expressions like well and you know. The 
definitional characteristics of the discourse markers is that they have to operate on 
the level of discourse, that is, link different units of discourse beyond the level of the 
sentence (cf. Degand 2016). In this thesis, I differentiate between discourse markers 
and discourse connectives, but in the literature the two notions are often treated as 
interchangeable. In fact, the boundaries of the class of discourse markers tend to be 
delimited differently by different authors (cf. Lenk 1997:  1-2), which can make 
navigating the literature on the topic a confusing task.  
Different subdivisions have been suggested for the class of discourse markers (cf. e.g. 
Pons Bordería 2001; Zufferey & Degand 2013) , and reviewing all of them is beyond 
the scope of this thesis. A sub -category of discourse markers relevant to t his thesis is 
that of ‘interpersonal’ discourse markers (cf. e.g. Maschler 2012) . The function of 
interpersonal markers is to negotiate the relationship between the speakers in 
 
133 
 
discourse. This includes indicating different aspects of their role in discourse, as well 
as their relationship to the information conveyed. A subtype of interpersonal markers 
are ‘epistemic discourse markers’, used to negotiate or index the role of the speaker 
with re spect to the information conveyed (cf. Maschler & Schiffrin 2015) . In the 
sections that follow, I show that TK marks such interpersonal/epistemic meanings 
with a paradigm of discourse enclitics.  
Cross-linguistically, discourse markers  have been analysed as contributing a 
particular kind of meaning to the utterance. As mentioned above, Fraser (1996) sees 
them as contributing to ‘pragmatic, rather than propositional meaning’. Blakemore , 
who (2002) analysed discourse markers  using Relevance Theory, pointed out that 
they raise important questions about how linguistic expressions relate  to context. 
Blakemore (2002) viewed semantics as part of grammar which deals with meanings 
that are linguistically encoded, in isolation from context (cf. Rosales Sequeiros 2012: 
21). She proposes that dis course markers do not make a contribution to the meaning 
of the utterance or proposition per se, but rather have ‘procedural meaning’, i.e. 
provide cues for interpretation of utterances by constraining the derivation of 
implicatures (Blakemore 2002: chap. 5; Rosales Sequeiros 2012: sec. 4.2). While the 
distinction between ‘procedural’ and ‘conceptual’ meaning is specific to Relevance 
Theory, it relates to the distinction between truth -conditional and non -truth-
conditional meaning as understood more generally within semantic and pragmatic 
research. The notions of truth -conditional and non -truth conditional meaning  are 
introduced below.  
The truth-conditional approach to semantics assumes that language is used primar ily 
to describe the  world. Consequently, for every sentence, there is a set of conditions 
that have to apply in the world for the utterance of that sentence to be true. These are 
the truth-conditions of an utterance (Rosales Sequeiros 2012:  5). If a linguistic 
expression has a truth -conditional meaning, it makes a difference to the truth 
conditions of the utterance in which it occurs: it affects what the world would have to 
look like for that utterance to be true. In truth -conditional semantics, the truth -
conditional meaning of an utterance is considered its core meaning – the proposition 
expressed (cf. e.g. Rosales Sequeiros 2012: 24). However, there are also meaningful 
linguistic expressions which do not describe states of affairs in the world, but modify 
 
134 
 
different aspects of verbal communication. Since such expressions do not contribute 
to the truth conditions of an utterance, their meaning is non -truth-conditional. Most 
discourse connectives are considered to have non -truth-conditional meaning (cf. e.g. 
Blakemore 2002: chap. 2).  
In TK, two classes of expressions qualify as discourse markers according to the 
definitions given above.  The first are independent lexical words which indicate 
relations between the different segments of discourse, marking relations such as 
causality, contradiction etc.27  
(3.1)  
Chi-raygu   ñuka   pagrachu-ni  ashka-ra  Awa   Yaya   Dios-ta. 
D.DEM-CAUSAL   1SG  thank-1 much-ACC high father  god-ACC

3SG=mi       1PL-ACC       strength-ACC   give-ANT intelligence-ACC give-ANT 
‘That’s why I thank High Father God very much. He ha s given us strength, he has 
given us intelligence [to keep working].’ 
 in_03072013_02    048-9 
In (3.1) the adverbial chiraygu functions as a causal connective, linking the 
proposition given in the example to the previous one i n discourse. This and similar 
expressions fit Schiffrin’s (1987) and Fraser’s (1990) definition of discourse markers: 
they are (often) clause -initial, and indicate the relationship between units of 
discourse. In this thesis, I refer to these lexical words as ‘discourse particles’.  
The enclitic =mi shown in (3.1) is an example of the second class of TK discourse 
markers: word-final bound morphemes, occurring on hosts from different word 
classes. These word -final particles enhance effective communication, but the 
meaning of most of them cannot be defined in terms of linking discourse units. 
Consequently, they can be distinguished from discourse connective particles not only 
on the basis of their morphosyntax, but also on the basis of their semantics. These 
word-final ‘discourse markers’ are the focus of the remainder of this thesis.  
                                                 
27 An attempt at cataloguing discourse relations has been made e.g. by  Prasad et al. (2007), but no 
catalogue of them that would be universally accepted and used in linguistic research has  been created 
to date (Manfred Stede, p.c. 06/02/2017).  
 
135 
 
 TK discourse enclitics: basis for analysis 3.2
The word-final particles introduced above have consistently been analysed as 
enclitics within Quechuan studies (cf. e.g. Cusihuamán 1976; Cole 1982; Cerrón -
Palomino 1976; Floyd 1997; Faller 2002; Sánchez 2010) . As far as I am aware, they 
have not previously been described in Quechuan studies as ‘discourse markers’, but  
their characteristics mentioned by the grammatical descriptions are consistent with 
this analysis. Cusihuamán notes that the Cuzco Quechua  enclitics occur o n the 
‘utterance level’, and that some of them are used as linguistic devices which conjoin 
several utterances in discourse (1976: 81). Cerrón-Palomino (1987: 287) observes 
that the enclitics either relate the speaker to the utterance, or the utterances to one 
another.  
In this and the following sections, I show that the analysis  of TK word-final particles 
as enclitics also obtains in TK, and is compatible with their interpretation as 
discourse markers. First, I discuss the cross -linguistic properties of clitics  (3.2.1). 
Subsequently, I propose a list of criteria that can be used language-internally in order 
to single out members of the TK class of discourse enclitics (3.2.2). 
 Defining the cross-linguistic properties of clitics 3.2.1
The first study of clitics dates back to the XIXth century (Wackernagel 1892) , but 
their exploration within modern linguistics was pioneered by  Zwicky (1977), who  
defined clitics as phonologically dependent forms . Consequently, Zwicky and 
Pullum (1983) proposed a set of criteria which distinguish clitics from affixes, cite d 
in Figure 3.1: 
Figure 3.1 Criteria for distinguishing clitics and affixes 
A. Clitics can exhibit a low degree of selection with respect to their hosts, 
while affixes exhibit a high degree of selection with respect to their 
stems. 
B. Arbitrary gaps in the set of combinations are more  characteristic of 
affixed words than of a clitic groups. 
C. Morphophonological idiosyncrasies are more characteristic of affixed 
words than of clitic groups. 
 
136 
 
D. Semantic idiosyncrasies are more characteristic of affixed words than 
of clitic groups. 
E. Lexical inte grity: Syntactic rules can affect words, but cannot affect 
clitic groups. 
F. Clitic-affix ordering: Clitics can attach to material already containing 
clitics, but affixes cannot. 
The wording of criteria A and F is self -explanatory, and consequently the discussion 
below concentrate s on the criteria B -E. While both affixes and clitics are bound 
elements, for Zwicky and Pullum (1983) the difference between them seems to lie in 
the fact that affixes are associated with words, and ‘hence with the kinds of 
idiosyncrasies to which words are subject ’ (Spencer & Luis 2012: 108) . Clitics, on 
the other hand, are associated with phrases, and thus ‘show the kind of regularity an d 
well-behavedness that we more usually associate with syntax’ (Spencer & Luis 
2012:108). Consequently, Zwicky and Pullum also predict that clitics should show 
fewer arbitrary gaps in combination with their hosts than affixes do (criterion B). 
Spencer and Luís point to the fact that inflectional parad igms across languages 
exhibit arbitrary gaps (2012: 109), while on criterion B, clitics are not supposed to 
have gaps in their paradigms. However, this is not always the case, as shown e.g. by 
Miller (1992: 175-6) in his discussion of French pronominal clitics.  
The criteria C and D state that affixed words are more prone to morphophon ological 
and semantic irregularities, respectively, than combinations of clitics with their hosts. 
The ‘morphophonological idiosyncrasies’ are irregular changes in the phonological 
form, which cannot be predicted from regular phonological processes affecti ng other 
words or groups of words. Zwicky and Pullum predict that such irregularities occur 
more often in combination of stems and affixes than in those of clitic hosts and clitics. 
By the same token, the ‘semantic idiosyncrasies’ (criterion D), whereby th e same 
affix can express different meanings, should not apply to clitics, which are supposed 
to have a single meaning across contexts (cf. Spencer & Luis 2012: 109 -10). The 
criterion E refers to ‘lexical integrity’ and states that clitic groups cannot be affected 
by syntactic processes independently of their host. That is, a host=clitic combination 
behaves syntactically like a word, just like the stem-affix combination. 
 
137 
 
The above criteria  became a point of reference for further work on clitics in many 
languages. However, they do not describe  properties of clitics per se, but rather list 
their properties as relative to those of affixes. This, in turn, makes Zwicky and 
Pullum’s criteria difficult to apply in this thesis without providing a detailed 
discussion of the character istics of different types of TK affixes  – something that 
falls outside the scope of this study. Consequently, a set of properties of clitics more 
suited for my research purposes is the one devised by Spencer and Luís (2012),  
presented in Figure 3.2.  
Figure 3.2 Properties of clitics  
1. Clitics express functional (inflectional) categories or discourse 
functions. 
2. Clitics are generally unstressed (and unstressable). 
3. Clitics require a host to attach to. 
4. Clitics show low selectivity towards their hosts (promiscuous 
attachment). 
5. Clitics typically appear in rigidly ordered clusters (templates). 
6. Clitics and clitic clusters often have different syntax from fully -
fledged words. 
Adapted from Spencer & Luís (2012: 37) 
The properties listed in  Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2 overlap to a large extent, which 
could lead us to conclude that once a  bound linguistic item has been defined as not 
being an affix, it can be straightforwardly be analysed as clitic. However, cross -
linguistically the properties of clitics can vary, and in a given language they need not 
exhibit all the properties listed abov e. Rather, the cross -linguistic affix -clitic 
distinction is more a matter of degree.  
Both sets of properties state that clitics attach to words from different word -classes – 
Zwicky and Pullum call this ‘low selectivity’ (criterion A) and Spencer and Luís 
refer to this characteristic as ‘promiscuous attachment’ (property 4). Zwicky and 
Pullum’s set of criteria does not state explicitly that clitics are phonologically 
dependent on their hosts, but it assumes so in comparing them to affixes, which are 
bound a nd phonologically dependent (Zwicky & Pullum 1983: 502) . Spencer and 
 
138 
 
Luís’s properties 2 and 3 account for the same property, stating that clitics require a 
host, and are generally unstressed. Zwicky and Pullum’s criteria E and F stem from 
the assumption that ‘no syntactic operations apply after cliticisation’ (Zwicky & 
Pullum 1983: 504) . The rigid ordering of clitic cluster s from Spencer and Luís’s 
property 5 is somewhat similar in nature, although it does not determine the ordering 
of cliticisation with respect to other morphosyntactic processes.  
The properties listed by Spencer and Luís which do not have parallels in Zwicky and 
Pullum’s (1983) criteria are those numbered 1, 6 and 7. Importantly from the point of 
view of this  thesis, Spencer and Luís’s property 1 distinguishes between clitics 
marking ‘inflectional categories’ and ‘discourse functions’. Inflectional categories 
are syntactically obligatory, (e.g. tense) , whereas  ‘discourse functions’ are context -
dependent and not required by syntax (see Section 3.1). Spencer and Luís’s division 
between ‘inflectional’ and ‘discourse’ clitics is mirrored in other analyses of clitics, 
e.g. by Anderson, who distinguishes between clitics ‘representing grammatical 
material’, and those with ‘more semanti c content’, such as discourse markers and 
adverbials (2005: 4). 
Property 6 states that the syntax of clitics and clitic clusters often differs from that of 
fully-fledged words. In discussing this property, Spencer and Luís refer mainly to the 
second position (2P) clitics, which appear after the first accented word or phrase  in 
the clause (Spencer & Luís 2012: 17). They suggest that clitics, unlike affixes, ‘show 
considerable sensitivity to syntax’, but are still essentially ‘morphological ob jects’ 
which depend phonologically, prosodically, and – to varying extents – syntactically – 
on their hosts (cf. Spencer & Luís 2012: 176 -7). Co nsequently, the distribution of  
‘fully fledged’ words is much freer than that of clitic (clusters).  
In the case of Tena Kichwa, co mparing the syntax of clitics with that of free stems 
from other grammatical categories seems to be of limited descriptive or analytical 
use. The TK clitics only have ‘prosodically bound forms’ (Anderson 2005: 18) , and 
therefore, in terms of their ‘word-ness’ (cf. Kibrik 2011), they resemble affixes much 
more than unbound stems . T he semantic and syntactic differences between TK 
affixes and clitics are already captured by the other properties pro posed by Spencer 
and Luís. Most notably, unlike affixes, TK clitics attach to host from different word 
classes, and their participation in the stress assignment of their host is optional.

 Properties of discourse enclitics in TK 3.2.2
Drawing on the characteristics of clitics discussed above, I propose a list of 
properties that can be used to determine membership in the class of ‘discourse 
enclitics’ in TK:  
Figure 3.3 Properties of TK discourse enclitics 
A. Promiscuous attachment/ low host selectivity. 
B. Phonological and prosodic dependency on the host. 
C. Little morphophonological and semantic idiosyncrasy. 
D. Being subject to few co-occurrence restrictions. 
E. Position at the right edge of the word, in rigidly ordered clusters. 
F. Expressing meanings related to discourse, rather than required by syntax. 
The properties listed in Figure 3.3 encompass the most important aspects of the 
general clitic properties discussed in Section 3.2.1, and make them relevant to TK . 
Properties A to E  account for the phonological, prosodic and morphosyntactic 
characteristics a marker should exhibit to be analysed as a clitic. Property E, which 
specifies that clitics s hould be positioned at the right edge of the word, is based on 
the fact that TK is exclusively suffixing, and all clitics in TK are in fact enclitics. 
Property F introduces a functional criterion which a marker should meet in order to 
be analysed as a ‘discourse’, rather than an ‘inflectional’ enclitic.  
Notions such as ‘discourse’ and ‘context’ as understood in this  thesis were defined in 
Section 1.3.2, but I re-introduce them for the sake of clarity. I understa nd ‘discourse’ 
as ‘a coherent string of propositions’ (Dijk 2010: 182) , that is, a string of  
conceptually related  propositions. The ‘context’ of any given discourse refers to 
extra-linguistic aspects of the speech situ ation, including, but not limited to: 
situational and communicative setting, relationships between interlocutors, and the 
interlocutors’ assumptions about one another’s state of mind.  
From these definitions, it follows that markers required for syntactic well-formedness 
of clauses, or expressing context-independent grammatical meanings , should not be 
analysed as ‘discourse markers’ . The occurrence of discourse enclitics is not 
conditioned by  syntax. Rather, they are used to enhance discourse coherence by 
 
140 
 
encoding ‘cues for interpretation, (…) emphasis, rhetorical effects, or the attitude of 
the speaker’ (cf. Spencer & Luis 2012: 35).  
 Inventory and distribution of TK enclitics 3.3
This section describe s the basic morphosyntactic and semantic properties of the 
enclitics attested in the TK corpus . The markers were  selected on the basis of the 
criterion of low selectivity/promiscuous attachment (see Section 3.2.1). I included all 
the markers which were attested to occur on hosts from more than one major TK 
word-class. Markers which occur on nouns, adjectives and pronouns were not 
included as exhibiting promiscuous attachment, since all these sub -classes belong to 
the major word -class of nominals (see  Chapter 2). Markers which occurred on both 
nominals and nominalised verbs functioning as arguments, or on verbs and  de-verbal 
nouns, were considered to belong to nominal and verbal inflection patterns, 
respectively, and were also not considered here. This left fifteen markers, which I 
describe below.  
 Inventory of TK enclitics  3.3.1
The class of enclitics presented below ha ve been id entified by means of mining the  
13-hour corpus of TK and by comparing the TK data with previous work on 
Quechuan (e.g. Parker 1969; Cole 1982; Weber 1986; Cusihuamán 2001) . 
Nonetheless, the analysis presented in this and the following sections is based mainly 
on the ‘elicited discourse’ part of the corpus  (see Section 1.3.4.2) comprising 2:03h 
of elicited discourse, i.e. 1537 turns uttered by six native speakers (3 female, 3 male, 
aged 18 -ca.50). Where possible and/or necessary, the elicited discourse data are 
supplemented by data from the 11h corpus of naturalistic discourse. Since that part of 
the corpus has been transcribed and translated, but not fully parsed and glossed, 
information such as the total number of tokens of a given marker were only extracted 
in cases wher e the phonologica l shape of the discourse marker  in question did not 
coincide with (a combination of) other inflectional or derivational markers . Figure 
3.4 shows all the encl itics attested in the TK corpus and bri efly describes how they 
have been analysed previously.

Figure 3.4 shows that the inventory of TK enclitics differs from those described for 
other varieties. For instance the ‘certainty enclitic ’ =puni, found  in Peruvian 
Quechua (Parker 1969; Cusihuamán 1976/2001; Faller 2002) , does not occur in TK  
(although it is functionally similar to the marker =tá, see Section 3.3.2.5).   
Parker (1969: 85) describes Ayacucho Quechua  word stress shifts  from its default 
position on the penultimate syllable to the final syllable as an enclitic /=Á/. In 
Ayacucho, this stress shift conveys emphasis, and occurs ‘only in polite or intimate 
address’. Adelaar (2013: 107)  describes a similar phenomenon  in Tarma Quechua, 
where the stress shift,  certain clitics, or combination of  both, are characteristic of 
exclamations. The shift of word stress from penultimate to final syllable also occurs 
in TK. I regard it as a prosodic strategy , and briefly discuss it  in Section 3.3.2.5, in 
relation to the properties it shares with the enclitic =tá.  
Little has been said in previous work on Quechua about the frequency with which the 
enclitics listed above occur in discourse. One of the exceptions is Wanka Quechua, 
for which =mi occurred ‘in 66%  of utterances in which it was grammatically 
permissible’ (Floyd 1997). This statement is difficult to compare with the  TK data, 
since the criteria of ‘grammatical permissibility’ were not specified  further. However, 
=mi has occurred in under 6% of all turns in the analysed part of the corpus, which is 
radically different from the 66% given by Floyd.   
Table 3.1 shows the total number of occurrences of each marker in the corpus of  
elicited discourse (1537 turns), and their mean occurrence rate, with the exception of 
=ri, not attested in the elicited discourse corpus. The figures in Table 3.1 are more in 
line with the numbers given by Weber (1989: 428), who states that in t he sample of 
Huánuco Quechua texts he analysed, the ‘topic’ marker =qa occurs at most 0.67 
times per sentence, and ‘evidential’ markers at most 0.57 times. While comparing the 
frequencies with which the enclitics  occur across varieties  would be a likely source 
of insight into their function in discourse,  such comparative research will not be 
pursued here for reasons of space.

The varying numbers of tokens also translate into varying possibilities of analysis , 
which I take into  account in the ensuing discussion. As mentioned above, w hen 
necessary, I provide examples from other parts of the corpus.   
 Morphosyntactic properties of TK enclitics  3.3.2
In this section, I discuss the basic morphosynta x and semantics of the enclitics listed 
in Figure 3.4.29 For each marker, I discuss (a) which phrasal categories it attaches to; 
(b) its function; (c) its co -occurrence restrictions (d) its contributi on to the stress 
                                                 
28 This measure indicates how frequently, on average, a given marker occurs per turn. To calculate it, I 
have divided the number of occurences of each marker in the corpus by the number of turns (1537 ) in 
the elicited discourse coprus. 
29 In the previous chapters, some of the particles discussed in this section were assigned interpretative 
glosses. In this section, I do not provide interpretative glosses for the enclitics, so as not to distract the 
reader from their properties. In the following chapters, the markers which are not included in the 
‘discourse enclitic’ paradigm are assigned interpretative glosses.

pattern of its hosts. 30  Each sub -section finishes with a summary of the 
morphosyntactic features of the marker.  
3.3.2.1 =ga 
There are 112 tokens of =ga in the 2-hour part of the corpus considered in this 
chapter. In most described Quechuan varieties, =ga and its cognates, =ka and =qa, 
have been analysed as topic markers (cf. e.g. Parker 1969; Cerrón -Palomino 1976; 
Muysken 1995; Cusihuamán 1976/2001; Faller 2002; Sánchez 2010; Muntendam 
2015), although Sánchez (2010: 91) mentions an early analys is based on the notion 
of saliency, where =qa was analysed as marking focus. In Unified Kichwa  (see 
Section 1.2.2), due to the absence of  contrast between the voiced and unvoiced velar 
stops, the marker is pronounced [ka] in all environments. Consequentl y, int er-
speaker variation exists in TK between the [ka] and [ga] pronunciations. In what 
follows, I refer to the marker as =ga. Table 3.2 presents the distribution of the tokens 
of =ga with different types of hosts:  
Table 3.2 Distribution of =ga with different types of hosts

tokens

Percentage

22.3 47.3 15.2 9.8 5.4 100 
Table 3.2 shows that almost 70% of the token of =ga occur on nouns , and personal 
and demonstrative pronouns.  A further 15.2% occur on verbs, all of which are non -
finite or nominalised. 9.8% occur on adverbs of place and time.  The remaining 5% 
occur on discourse connectives such as ‘on the other hand’ ( randi) (n=5) and ‘then’ 
(shinakpi) (n=1). The implications of s uch distribution for the analysi s of =ga as a 
topic marker are discussed in Section 4.4.  
Like all the other TK enclitics, =ga always attaches at the right edge of the host, 
following the inflectional morphology:

and without the enclitic in question.

Note that all the items from all the grammatical categories which act as hosts for =ga 
can also function as phrasal heads.  In (3.2), =ga occurs twice: on a pronoun 
functioning as the head  of an oblique pronominal phrase, and on a nominalised verb 
in a locative relative clause, co -referential with the =ga-marked oblique. In all 
examples of =ga occurring on nominal and pronominal phrases,  the marker attaches 
to the head of the phrase , which,  given that TK is a head -final language, also 
conincides with the right edge of the phrase:

In both examples in (3.3), the distal demonstrative chi functions as a dependent in the 
subject NP, and therefore, as shown in  (3.3b), it cannot be affixed with =ga. This is 
not the case in  (3.4), where the demonstrative itself is the head of the subject ProP 
(the finite verb is elided). In both ‘elicited discourse ’ and ‘naturalistic discourse ’ 
parts of the corpus, =ga was not attested on adjectival modifi ers, which confirms the 
claim that it can only occur on phrasal heads (see below for discussion of VPs).  
The examples above show that =ga can occur on subject s, as in (3.3), and obliques, 
as in (3.2). Example (3.5) showcases a token of =ga on a direct object NP: 
(3.5)

The distribution of =ga on phrases fulfilling the different grammatical roles in a 
clause is described in more detail in Section 4.4, where I discuss the  correlation of 
the occurrence of =ga with the information structural category of topic.  
The marker =ga also occurs on verbs and adverbs. In (3.2) above, =ga attached to a 
nominalised verb within a headless relative clause. In the 2h corpus discussed here, 
17 tokens of =ga occurred on verbal hosts. In all these cases, however, =ga occurred 
on non -finite verbs – i.e. verbs not inflected for tense and person. Five t okens 
occurred on verbs affixed with suffixes -kpi (DS) and -sha (SS), indicating action 
concomitant to that expressed by the main verb (see Section 2.5.3.2.3):

Example (3.8) contains two relative clauses, one of which is marked with =ga. The

The examples above indicate thain relative clauses, unlike in NPs, =ga does not seem 
to have a fixed position. Nonetheless, it always occurs on heads of either VP or AdvP, 
which confirms the observation that it only attaches to phrasal heads.  
In the 2h part of the corpus analysed here, =ga was not attested on finite verbs. In the 
bigger, 11h corpus of conversational data, =ga also mainly occurs on verbal hosts in 
environments described above. However, occurrences on  finite verbs are also 
attested. Consider the example below:  
(3.10)  
Kumuna  kallarishkawnara  iyay     chariniga… 
kumuna kallari-shka-guna-ta iya-y    chari-ni=ga

‘I remember [lit. have an idea] about the ones who started the community…’ 
KICHB07AGOPEDROCHIMBO1    015 
Weber (1989: 394) mentions that in Huánuco Quechua, the marker =ga also does, 
though very seldom, occur on main verbs, and hypothesises that such occurences 
might be limited to the second mention of the action refered to by the verb hosting 
the marker. This hypothesis is explored for TK in Section 4.4.  
 
149 
 
Tokens of =ga on finite verbs mostly occur on  verbs in the present tense – no 
examples of =ga were attested on the same host with PST -ka, and when =ga 
occurred on the same host  as the FUT marker  -nga, it was never with future time 
reference (see Section 2.4.2.2.4). Moreover, occurrences of =ga on verbal hosts seem 
to be restricted to discourse genres such as personal narratives or cer emonial songs. 
For instance, out of 90 co-occurrences of =ga with the first person present marker -ni, 
68 were uttered by the same participant, a virsaru — traditional wedding singer and 
violin player — as he was singing a narrative song at a wedding. The wedding chant 
has a specific rhythm, in which each verse consists of four syllables, and it seems 
that the ‘free enclitics’ are often used in such songs more liberally than in other 
discourse genres, as the y allow the singer  an opportunity  to fill the gaps  in the 
rhythm. The details of the distribution of =ga across discourse genres fall outside the 
scope of this work, but could be an interesting contribution to future research on TK 
discourse enclitics.  
Occurrences of =ga are also attested on discourse connectives, such as randi (‘on the 
other hand’) or shinakpi (‘so’/’therefore’): 
(3.11)  
Mana.   Ñuka-j-pi             randi=ga            shuk   tunu.

‘So then these days we have become quite troubled.’  
KICHB07AGOPEDROCHIMBO2   150 
The occurrence of =ga on clausal connectives was also described by Weber (1989: 
394) for Huánuco Quechua (QI). The examples above are discussed in more detail in  
Section 4.4.   
 
150 
 
In terms of the distributional properties of the mark er, the discussion above has 
shown that it always occurs on the head of the syntactic co nstituent to which it 
attaches. As I show in the following sections describing the properties of TK 
enclitics, occurrence on phrasal heads is the property of the majori ty of TK word -
final markers . The occurrence on phrasal heads is in line with the descriptions of 
cognates of =ga in other Quechuan dialects.  I come back to the distributional 
similarities and differences between =ga in TK and its cognates in other Quechuan  
varieties in Section 4.4.   
Another property of the TK =ga is that it  can also occur more than once within the 
same clause , but not within the same phrase . Multiple occurrences of =ga in one 
clause are also discussed in more detail in Chapter 5. The examples above indicate in 
relative clauses, unlike in NPs, = ga does not seem to have a fixed position. What 
arises, however, is the issue of the scope the marker takes. In NPs and ProPs, where 
=ga obligatorily occurs on phrasal heads, i t takes scope over the entire phrase, as in 
examples (3.2) and (3.3a) above. When occurring on non-finite verbs, as in (3.6) and 
(3.7), =ga takes scope over the whole subordinate clause. The scope properties of 
=ga in relative clauses require a closer investigation, but a preliminary conclusion 
should be that independently of its position within it, =ga takes scope over the whole 
RC. In (3.8) above, the RC is co -referential with the topical, =ga-marked subject. In 
(3.9), the occurrence of =ga on the first r elative clause could be interpreted as 
associated with a contrastive topic (see Section  4.4), since the referents  of both 
relative clauses are candidates for topicality. The marker =ga attaches to the locative 
adverb washa (‘after’), since the two referents competing for topical status contrast 
in position, designated by the adverb. 
Lastly, it should be underlined that in none of the contexts described above is =ga 
grammatically obligatory. Its occurrences seem t o be motivated by discourse context 
and felicity conditions of utterances, rather than required for grammatical well -
formedness of clauses. This, however, raises the question of what factors might 
motivate the use of =ga in an utterance. In  Chapter 4, I explore this issue, showing 
that the distribution of the marker can be accounted for – at least to an extent – by 
considerations related to information structure.  
 
151 
 
It is also prudent to mention that the meaning conveyed by =ga cannot be questioned 
or negated, which suggest that the marker makes no contribution to the truth -
conditions of the utterances in which it occurs.    
There are numerous co-occurrence restrictions on =ga. Both parts of the corpus were 
mined for co-occurrences of the word-final markers, and =ga is attested on the same 
host with the additive =pas, the limitative =lla and the ‘identity of reference’ marker 
=llara. When occurring with other word -final markers, =ga always attaches outside 
them, as illustrated below:  
(3.13)  
Payska               /    *paygas   maytacha,              rinawn, 
pay  =pas =ga    /      pay=ga=pas  may   =ta  =cha      ri -nun 
3SG =pas =ga   /       3SG=ga=pas      where =ta =cha    go -3PL

‘They too...where could they be going, they are going far, those kids.’ 
el_24092014_03   75 
One exception from this rule is the co -occurrence of =ga with th e emphatic =ri, 
which was attested only once in the entire corpus, and where =ri attaches outside 
=ga. As for the co -occurrence of =ga with the emphatic interrogative =y (see 
Section 3.3.2.10), it requires further investigation, as there seems to be inter -speaker 
variation as to the permissibility o f the two markers occurring on the same host.  For 
the Q/NEG marker =chu, several cases were attested in the corpus, but only in the 
ceremonial wedding songs mentioned above, where the markers are likely to be used 
for rhythmic purposes, even if the semantic contributions they make to the clause are 
contradictory. The co -occurrence of =chu and =ga is ungrammatical in everyday 
discourse contexts, possibly due t o their ass ociation with different information -
structural categories  (see Chapter 4 ). The same is true for the remaining markers 
from Figure 3.4: =mi, =ma, =mari, =cha, =chari, =tá, which was conf irmed in 
elicitation. No tokens of =ga were attested to co -occur with =guti, but the co -
 
152 
 
occurrence possibilities of the two markers was not tested in elicitation tasks. The co-
occurrence of the markers on the clausal level is discussed in Chapter 4. 
The data suggests that =ga can, but does not have to affect stress assignment. I n TK, 
word stress tends to fall  on the penultimate syllable (see Section 2.1.2.2). Out of the 
112 tokens of =ga, only in 10 cases was the word stress ass ignment of the host 
affected by the presence of the enclitic. Consider:  
(3.14)  
a'pa.sha    kall'paw.ga             ña,  chi   chu'ri.wa 
apa  -sha  kallpa-w  =ga          ña   chi   churi -wa

again  run     -3         yes 
‘(S/he) runs again, yes!’ 
el_25092014_02   63 
In (3.14) the marker =ga occurs on the verb, influencing its lexical stress assignment. 
As shown in (3.15), when the same verb is affixed with the 3SG present agreement 
suffix, the lexical stress is also on the penulti mate syllable. A different pattern is 
shown below:  
(3.16)  
shu   'pun.da.ga,  shu  'kari          'lluk.shin

‘down [there], in the corner’ 
el_03102014_01   016 
Examples (3.14) through (3.17) show that the effect of =ga on stress assignment is 
optional. According t o the data,  whether or not the marker affects stress assignment 
does not depend on the type of host, or on the speaker. However, a more systematic 
investigation of the interaction of =ga with different types of hosts and affixes, as 
well as with secondary stress, is needed in the future. This is in line with the need of 
a more thorough study of TK prosody and intonation in general. Only preliminary 
studies of these aspects of the language are available and they suggest that several 
TK suffixes also have an optional effect on lexical stress assignment (see Section  
2.1.2.2). Nonetheless, on the basis of this preliminary analysis, we can conclude that 
=ga only optionally affects the stress pattern of its hosts.  
To sum up, =ga can occur on hosts from every grammatical category, although it is 
more frequent with non-finite than with finite verbs. The marker is not grammatically 
obligatory in any context, but it might be required for felicity of utterances . The 
cognates of =ga were analysed as topic marker s for other Quechuan varieties, and 
this analysis can be sustain ed for its occurrences on (pro)nominal hosts in TK, but is 
somewhat more problematic in case of =ga occurring on hosts from other 
grammatical categories. The issues pertaining to the IS function of =ga are discussed 
in detail in Section 4.4. The marker can co-occur on the same host with the enclitics 
=llara, =pas, and =ri, but not with any of the other enclitics, which is to be e xpected 
given that most of the remaining enclitics are associated with marking different types 
of focus structures (see Section 4.5). The marker can, but in most cases does not, 
affect the stress pattern of its host.  
3.3.2.2 =mi 
The marker =mi has received more attention than any other enclitic in the  literature 
on Quechuan. It has been variously analysed as ‘validational’ (e.g. Adelaar 1977; 
 
154 
 
Cole 1982; Calvo Pérez 1993), a direct evidential (e.g. Weber 1986; Floyd 1997) , an 
illocutionary modifier indicating  ‘best possible ground’ (e.g. Faller 2002) , an 
assertive marker (e.g. Nuckolls 1993) , a focus marker (cf. e.g. Muysken 1995; 
Sánchez 2010; Muntendam 2015)  and a marker of epistemic certainty (cf. Weber 
1986; Floyd 1997).  
In the 2h corpus discussed here, 92  tokens of =mi were attested. The ir distribution 
with hosts from different grammatical categories is shown in Table 3.3 below:  
 
Table 3.3 Distribution of =mi with different types of hosts

In Table 3.3, the verb/predicate category  of hosts given above  includes finite, non-
finite, and nominalised  verbs, as well as nominal and adjectival predicates . The 
inclusion of the latter construction type in the category of verbal hosts is motivated 
by the fact that in all predicates involving periphrastic constructions several 
discourse enclitics, including =mi can occur as an enclitic on  the predicate. I n such 
cases, the copula can, especially in rapid sp eech, get encliticised to the predi cate 
nominal to the right of the enclitic. When occurring in this context, the enclitic =mi 
is realised as =m. However, the enclitic =m can be disambiguated as either =mi or 
=ma (see Section 3.3.2.3). Consequently, the 16 tokens of the clitic =m found in the 
2h corpus have been excluded from the count  presented in this chapter. An example 
of =m is shown below:  
(3.18)  
Mana   cocoma,           kay     shukma         kay

‘[It was] not [a] coconut, here in the other one [video], this one in mine was [a] 
coconut…’ 
el_24092014_03   07 
In the periphrastic predicative constructions such as (3.18) the enclitic ‘floats’ around 
the clause, and can occur on either the predicate or the AUX/COP w ithout a change 
in meaning. As mentioned above, due to their possible ambiguity, such constructions 
were excluded from the count of the tokens of both =mi and =ma in this thesis.  
There are 92 tokens in the corpus which can be glossed unambiguously as occurrence 
of =mi. Almost 50% of those occur  on nominal and pronominal hosts. Like =ga, the 
enclitic =mi always attaches to heads of nominal and pronominal phrases, and occurs 
on constituents fulfilling different grammatical functions, including subjects (3.19), 
objects (3.20) and adjuncts (3.21): 
(3.19) =mi on a subject

The occurrences of =mi on non-core arguments, exemplified in (3.21), are relatively 
infrequent in the corpus. This might be associated with the fact that =mi occurs on 
focal constituents (see Section 4.5.1). 
As mentioned above, =mi only occurs on phrasal heads. It does not occur on 
attributive adjectives, but can attach to predicative adjectives. Consider:  
(3.22)  
a. [shu   sumak  warmi=mi] shamu-ka  ñuka  wasi-ma

c. [Ñuka  warmi]  sumak=mi   a-n 
 1SG woman  beautiful=mi  COP-3 
  ‘My wife is beautiful.’ 
   elicited 
In modifying clauses, =mi can also only occur on the head noun: 
(3.23)  
a. shaya-j                   warmi =mi 
     stand-AG.NMLZ   woman=mi

el_24112014_01   066 
 
157 
 
The constrast between, (3.23 a), which is grammatical, and (3.23 b), which is not, 
confirms the observation that =mi, like =ga, cannot occur on nominal modifiers, and 
is restricted to heads of NPs and ProPs (see (3.19)). 
Another 38% of the tokens of =mi in the sample occurred on verbal and predicate 
hosts. Unlike =ga, =mi often occurs on finite verbs, and shows few restrictions with 
TAM morp hology ( see Section  2.4.2). The examples below show that =mi is 
compatible with present/progressive, past and future tense- and aspect-marking on its 
verbal host:

As shown above, =mi occurs both in assertive and interrogative clauses, although it 
is ungrammatical for it to co -occur on the same host with any of the interrogative 
 
158 
 
enclitics discussed in this chapter. The enclitic =mi is also ungrammatical on 
imperative verbs. I discuss this property of =mi in more detail in Section 5.3.3.1.  
The enclitic =mi was also found to occur on adverbial hosts (n=5). In: 
(3.28)  
uku-ma          tia-k   chundzulli-guna-ndi shamu-kpi,  yapa=mi   ismu-n.

KICHB07AGOPEDROCHIMBO1   446 
In AdvPs, =mi is also restricted to the head of the phrase. 
The final host-type attested in the sample were particles, including  those functioning 
as discourse connectives:  
(3.29)  
Ciertomi,  karan   wasi    paktasha,         makira  kusha

‘Of course, arriving in every house, we too have to arrive shaking hands.’  
el_16082013_01    105-6 
 
With regard to the occurrence of =mi on discourse connectives, it should be said that 
it differs substantially form the occurrence of the topic -marking =ga on the same 
type of hosts. For instance, in the 13h corpus, not a single instance of =mi occurring 
on the causal particle shinakpi (‘then’/’so’) was attested, while that same particle 
occurred 35 times in combination with =ga. This suggests that the two enclitics can 
be used to underline different types of discourse relations. 
In terms of its interaction with lexical stress assignment  (all types of hosts described 
above, including particles, have word stress) , =mi exhibits ambiguous behaviour. 
 
159 
 
The preliminary examination of 40 tokens of the enclitic shows that it tends not to 
affect the lexical stress assignment  of its hosts. The occurrence of =mi has only 
shifted the hosts stress pattern in one fifth (n=8) of the cases. No correlations were 
observed between the interaction of =mi with stress assignment and any particula r 
participant or host type.  
In the whole 13h corpus, =mi is attested to co -occur on the same host only with the 
additive enclitic =pas, the limitative =lla and the ‘identity of reference’ =llara, all of 
which always precede =mi. Elicitation data show that  it cannot be combin ed on the 
same host  with any of the other enclitics discussed in this chapter. The data  also 
show that =mi is not required for the grammaticality of sentences in which it occurs. 
It is, however, required for certain types of clauses to be felicitous, i.e. it occurs in 
threats, warnings, and in conditional clauses. The presence of =mi in these 
constructions, and the contribution it makes to the proposition expressed, are 
discussed in more detail in Section 5.3.3.  
To sum up, the enclitic =mi exhibits low host selectivity, attaching to a variety of 
phrasal categories . It occurs freely with TAM morphology on verbal hosts. It 
optionally affects the stress pattern of its hosts. It can co -occur on the same hosts 
with few other enclitics, and when it does, it always attaches to their right. Its 
occurrence is restricted to phrasal heads. On NPs and PPs, it is not restricted to 
constituents fulfilling a particular grammatical role. It is not required for the 
grammaticality of clauses in which it occurs, but can be required for felicity of 
certain speech acts.  
3.3.2.3 =ma 
The analyses of the cognates of =ma vary across Quechuan dialects. In Imbabura 
Quechua (QII, Cole 1982), =ma is glossed as an emphatic version of =mi. In Sihuas 
Quechua (Hintz & Hintz 2014a)  – as a ‘confirmation of mutual knowledge’. In 
Cuzco Quechua – as a marker of surprise (Faller 2002), or an impressive/emphatic  
enclitic (Cusihuamán 1976/2001). In TK, =mi and =ma appear to occur in free 
variation in many grammatical and discourse contexts (see example (3.18)), and they 
both exhibit a focus marking function (see Section 4.5.1).  
 
160 
 
The enclitic occurred 48 times in the elicited discourse corpus. The number of tokens 
in the naturalistic discourse corpus is difficult to assess, s ince the marker is 
homophonous with the Dative/Lative suffix -ma, and over 2200 words with word -
final -ma were encountered in that part of the corpus. Nonetheless, the tokens 
encountered in the 2h corpus allow an insight into the morphosyntactic properties  of 
the marker. The distribution of the tokens of =ma with different host-types is shown 
in Table 3.4.

In (3.30) =ma occurs on the head of an NP, and in (3.31) – on the head of a ProP. 
The marke r cannot grammatically occur on attribut ive adjectives, or on other NP 
modifiers. This shows that it is restricted to phrasal heads . According to the data, 
=ma is not restricted to NPs or ProPs with a particular grammatical function. The 
above shows that the distribution of =ma is analogous to that of =ga and =mi.   
More than 50% (n=25) of the tokens of =ma occurred on verbal hosts, and the 
majority of those (n=18) , on finite verbs. In this respect, the distribution of =ma 
differs substantially from that of =mi, which, in the analysed part of the  corpus, 
occurred mostly on nominalised and subordinate verb forms. On the whole, however, 
both =mi and =ma can co-occur with every TK tense and aspect marker:

For (3.32), the consultant suggested that the utterance would also be appropriate with 
=mi. More examples of the contex ts where those two markers occur in free variation 
are discussed in Section 5.3.3. Example (3.35), where =ma occurs on the same host 
with the future marker -nga is one of the only th ree examples in the 13h corpus 
where -nga and =ma co-occur on the same host, encoding future reference. In studies 
of other varieties of Quechua, it was suggested that what differentiates the 
direct/assertive marker =mi from the ‘direct experience’ marker =ma is the ability of 
=mi to occur in clauses with future time reference. Example (3.35) shows that this is 
not the case for TK, although the scarcity of =ma in clauses with future time 
reference might indicate that diachronic change might have occurred in this respect. 
However, this hypothesis would require a diachronic study well outside  the scope of 
the present work. The enclitic =ma also occurs on subordinate and nominalised verbs, 
as shown in (3.37) and (3.38), respectively:  
(3.37)

el_25092014_03   32 
 
163 
 
Although =ma occurs without restriction with TAM markers in the indicative mood, 
it is, like =mi, incompatible with imperative clauses.  
Apart from on nominal and verbal hosts, several (n=2) occurrences of =ma were also 
attested on adverbial hosts. Consider: 
(3.39)  
Paynaga            karurama   ririanawshka                  chiguna...

‘As for them, these ones have been going far..’ 
el_24092014_03   62 
Occurrence on adverbial hosts is another distributional parallel between =ma, and 
the markers =mi and =ga. Similarly to those enclitic, =ma was also atte sted on 
particles, such as ari (‘yes’) or shinarasha (‘therefore’). As for co -occurrence with 
other markers described in this chapter, i n the 13h corpus, =ma was attested to co -
occur with the limitative =lla and the ‘identity of reference’ = llara, and one 
occurrences was  found with the additive marker  =pas. In all of these cases, =ma 
attached to the right of the other enclitics.  
On the basis of the auditory an d pitch contour analysis of 48  tokens of =ma, it was 
established that it optionally affects lexica l stress assignment . The lexical stress of 
the host was affected by the occurrence of =ma in 11 out of 48 cases.  
In sum, =ma patterns similarly to the two markers described in the previous section s. 
It attaches to hosts from most all the major phrasal categories, always occurying on  
the phrasal heads. Although less frequent in discourse, semantically and 
distributionally, it seems to be similar to =mi; it also resembles that marker in its co -
occurrence restrictions with imperative verb forms. It optionall y participates in 
lexical stress assignment, and co -occurs on the same host with the same enclitics 
with which =mi also co-occurs.  
3.3.2.4 =mari  
In previous studies of Quechuan languages, =mari has been analysed as an 
‘emphatic equivalent’ of =mi (cf. Cole 1982; Floyd 1997; Faller 2002) . None of 
 
164 
 
these studies, however, define the  notion of ‘emphasis’ or specify the discourse 
context i n which the emphati c markers are felicitous.  The analysis of =mari as an 
emphatic version of =mi requires further discussion, which I provide in Chapter 4  
and Chapter 5 . The TK data does suggest that the meaning of =mari is to some 
extent related to that of =mi and =ma, since there are distributional and functional 
parallels between the three markers. 
The marker occurred only 13 times in the elicited discourse part of the corpus, but in 
the 11h corpus of naturalistic discourse, over 300 tokens of =mari were attested 
(n=306). While t he ensuing description of the marker’s properties was based on 
tokens from both parts of the corpus,  Table 3.5 only t akes the tokens from the 
‘elicited discourse’ corpus into account:

As shown in Table 3.5, despite the small sample size the tokens of =mari were 
attested on hosts from different word-classes. In the bigger part of the corpus, =mari 
was also attested on adverbial hosts and on particles, including discourse connectives.  
Like all the enclitics described above, =mari only occurs on  the heads of NPs and 
PPs. By the same token,  =mari was attested on predicative, but not attributive 
adjectives:  
(3.40)

el_02122014_05   007 
In the 13h of corpus data, =mari co-occurred with all tense and aspect markers, 
although only one token co -occurred with the FUT -nga (with FUT time reference). 
Like =mi and =ma, =mari cannot occur on imperative ve rbs. Also like the enclitics 
described above, =mari was attested on adverbial hosts: 
(3.44)  
Shina  a-j=mari,   kuna=mari,  illa-n.

‘It was like this, [and] now, there isn’t any [fish left in the river].’ 
in_25052013_02_03   089 
 
166 
 
The discussion and examples above show that the distributional properties of =mari 
as similar to those of the makers described in the previous sections.  
In terms of occurrences with other TK  word-final markers, =mari can co-occur on 
the same hos ts with the additive  =pas and the limitative =lla, as well as with the  
‘identity of reference’ =llara. In these clusters, =mari always occurs to the right of 
the other enclitics. The co -occurrence of =mari with other markers was not attested 
in the corpus,  and it’s been established in elicitation that it cannot co -occur on the 
same host with =ga, =mi, =ma, =chu, =cha or =chari. The marker =mari is not 
required for the syntactic well -formedness of the clauses in which it occurs, but, like 
=mi and =ma, seems to be required for the felicity of certain types of utterances.  
The preliminary auditory and pitch contour analysis carried out on the examples 
from the sample suggest that =mari optionally participates in stress assignment. In 
most cases (n=10), it did not alter the lexical stress falling on the penultimate syllable 
of its host . However, in the remaining three cases, its presence did alter the stress 
assignment. Incidentally, the examples w here stress was altered all come from the 
same speaker (nian1). To corroborate these results, 30 tokens of the marker extracted 
from the naturalistic discourse corpus were examined, uttered by four different 
speakers. In this case, =mari affected the stress assignment of its host in almost one 
third of the cases (n=9). T herefore, the data examined here allows a preliminary 
conclusion that =mari optionally participates in lexical stress assignment.  
In sum, the properties of =mari are similar to those of the previous markers 
described in this chapter. The marker occurs on all the major  phrasal categories, 
attaching to the head/right edge of the phrase . It occurs both on non -finite and on 
finite verbal hosts. It can co -occur on the same hosts with the same enclitics which 
also combine with =mi and =ma. When it does co -occur with other word -final 
markers, it always attaches to their right. It optionally affects  the stress pattern of its 
host. It is not required for the grammaticality of clauses in which it occurs.  
3.3.2.5 =tá 
The marker =tá was, to my knowledge, not described for any  other variety of 
Quechua. In TK, it is associated with verum focus, and  can be preliminarily defined 
here as a marker emphasising the expression of truth value of a proposition. I provide 
 
167 
 
a discussion of this notion, as well as of the information structur al contribution of 
=tá to the clause, in Section 4.5.2, focusing here on its morphosyntactic properties. 
Only four examples of =tá were attested in the elicited discourse context, and the 
naturalistic discourse corpus contained further thirteen  examples. The marker =tá, 
similarly to the accusative marker -ta, has three allomorphs: the underlying [tá], [dá] 
after nasals and [ɾá] – post-vocalically. As suggested by the orthography, =tá carries 
inherent stress.  
The distribution of the enclitic with the hosts from different phrasal categories  is 
shown in Table 3.6. The table contains occurrences from both parts of the corpus, 
with the numbers from the elicited discourse corpus given in brackets. 
Table 3.6 Distribution of =tá with different types of hosts

Percentage

11.8 5.9 5.9 52.9 23.5 100 
The categories in Table 3.6 differ slightly from those in other tables in  this chapter. 
While in all the other tables, predicative constructions are included in the category 
‘verb/predicate’ (see Section 3.3.2.1), in this case ‘ (de)verbal predicate ’ includes 
complex verbal predicate, and predicative  constructions with nominalised verbs, but 
all the other types of hosts are counted separately. The reason behind this change is 
that, irrespective of the grammatical category of the host, all the occurrences of =tá 
are in predicative constructions; such d istribution is typical of verum focus marking 
(see Section 4.5.2).  
Most of the tokens of =tá in the corpus occur in answers to questions, which is in 
line with its verum focus interpretation. An example of =tá in a question-answer pair 
is given below:  
 
 
168

       soil pot      =lla=tá    yes   
 ‘It is a clay pot, yes.’ 
in_26052013_02   113-114 
In (3.45), =tá occurs in the affirmative answer, attaching to the head of the NP 
queried in the question. The NP is used predicatively, and the copula ( a-, ‘to be’) is 
elided. The examples below shows a similar construction, with =tá attaching to a 
predicative numeral, as in (3.46), and a predicative adjective, as in (3.47):   
(3.46)  
A:  Ishki  Venecia  tia-n?

 ‘Are there two [villages called] Venecia?’

       bitter=tá 
  ‘(Yes), it IS bitter.’ 
in_05092014_01   033-035 
 
169 
 
In non-verbal predicates such as those shown above, the copula tends to be elided.   
On verbal hosts, = tá also occurs in affirmative answers or comments. The example 
below comes from a conversation in which two consultants were comparing the 
videos they watched, only differing in minor details:  
(3.48)  
A:  Chi     tia-ka=chu   kam-ba-j-pi ?         Telefono timbra-shka-wa... 
      D.DEM  be-PST =chu   2SG-GEN-BEN-LOC    phone      sound -ANT-INSTR

 ‘That's right, it was ringing there.’ 
el_05122014_01   017-8   
All four tokens of =tá on particles were attested on  the adverbial demonstrative  
shina (‘like.this’/’in.this.way’). Note that in B above shinay, clearly derived from 
shina, but which canno t be analysed as shina=y (see Section 3.3.2.10), functions as 
an assertive particle. The same function can be fulfilled by the more morphologically 
transparent co-occurrence of the adverbial with =tá:  
(3.49)

      like.this=tá 
 ‘That’s it.’ 
in_05092014_01   028-029 
 
170 
 
The examples above show that, despite there only being 17 tokens of =tá in the 
corpus, they are distributed across hosts from all the main TK grammatical categories, 
and consistently occur in a ffirmative answers to polar questions. In terms of co -
occurrence with other word-final markers, =tá was only attested to attach to the right 
of =lla, and to the left of =guti. However, its co -occurrence restrictions with other 
markers were not tested in el icitation. While the marker is not grammatically 
obligatory in any of the contexts where it occurs, it seems to affect the illocutionary 
strength of the utterance by emphasising its truth value (see Section 4.5.2).  
As mentioned above, =tá exhibits inherent stress, and therefore it always alters its 
hosts’ stress assignment pattern, which by default falls on the penultimate syllable 
(see Section 2.1.2.2). Consider:  
(3.50)  
a. mi.kuˈna   tianˈdzu ? 
         miku-na     tia-n=chu   
         eat-INF  exist-3=chu 
         ‘Is there [any] food?’  
b. ari,  mi.kuˈna   ˈtian 
          ari     miku-na    tia-n 
         yes  eat-INF    exist 
         ‘Yes, there is food.’ 
c. tianˈda

attested 
d. *ˈtian.da 
          tia-n=dá 
          exist-3=tá 
elicited 
 
171 
 
In (3.50) above, (a) is a question, and (b), ( c) and (d) are  possible or intended 
answers. Comparing (b) to (c), we see that the occurrence of the marker =tá changes 
the stress pattern of the host. Example  (d) shows that when =tá attaches to the host, 
stressing the penultimate syllable renders an ungrammatical result. It should also be 
mentioned that =tá has a falling pitch contour, while the interrogative  =ta (see 
Section 3.3.2.9) exhibits a rising contour, and the ACC -ta – a flat contour. 
An issue which requires further study is the relationship between the stress shift 
mentioned briefly in Section 3.3.1 and the marker =tá. As mentioned previously, the 
shifting of the lexical stress to the last syllable was analysed as an enclitic in previous 
descriptions of Quechua (cf. e.g. Parker 1969), and described as having an assertive 
function. While a detailed prosodic analysis of the TK data falls outside the scope of 
this study, the data suggest that the stress shift alone can serve a similar function, and 
has a similar distribution, to the instances of =tá discussed above. Consider: 
(3.51)  
A:   maˈma.ra        ? 
       mama-ta 
       mother-ACC   
 ‘[They did it] to [their] mother?’ 
B:  ma.maˈra  ru.ku.maˈma.ra 
      mama  -ta rukumama-ta 
      mother-ACC grandmother-ACC 
 ‘[Yes] To the mother. To the grandmother.’ 
ta_07062013_01    347-48 
It is cl ear from the discourse context that ‘mother’ occurs in the accusative, and, in 
answer to A’s question, B shifts the stress on the first part of the answer to the last 
syllable of the lexical word, but the marker =tá does not occur . I discuss the 
relationship between =tá and the lexical stress shift in more detail in Section 4.5.2.  
To sum up, the marker =tá exhibits promiscuous attachment and has inherent stress. 
In the corpus, it was only attested co -occurring on the same host with  enclitics =lla 
and =guti. The enclitic =tá is not required for the grammaticality of the  utterances in 
 
172 
 
which it occurs, but where it does occur, it seems to emphasise the truth value of the 
utterance. 
3.3.2.6 =chu 
Across the different varietie s of Quechua, the marker =chu has been analysed  as a 
negation and polar question marker  (cf. Cusihuamán 1976/2001; Cole 1982; Weber 
1989b; Faller 2002) . It has the same function in TK. When occurring together with 
the negative particle mana, it delimits the scope of negati on, and when occurring 
alone, it marks the focus of polar questions, as well as indicating doubt. It has two  
allomorphs: [d͡ ʒu] after nasals and [t͡ ʃu] in all other contexts. The distribution of the 
enclitic with different types of hosts is shown in Table 3.7: 
Table 3.7 Distribution of =chu with different types of hosts

Number of 
tokens 
15 23 3 2 43 
Percentage of 
tokens 
35 53.5 7 4.5 100 
A shown in Table 3.7, over half of the tokens of =chu in the elicited discourse corpus 
occurred on verbal hosts, and a further 35% – on nominal hosts. Only two tokens of 
=chu were attested on pronominal hosts in the 13h corpus, and few occurrences were 
found on adjectival hosts, only when these had a predicative function. This seems to 
indicate that, like other enclitics described so far, =chu only occurs on heads of 
nominal phrases.  
Note that =chu can also attach to both the predicate and the copula/auxiliary in non -
verbal and complex verbal predicates. Similarly to =mi/=ma (see Section 3.3.2.2), in 
such cases it can sometimes occur in the reduced f orm =ch, when the COP/AUX 
occurs as an enclitic on the predicate, to the right of the discourse enclitic. In such 
cases, the marker is ambiguous between =chu and =cha (see Section 3.3.2.7):

Similarly to the tokens ambiguous between =mi and =ma, markers ambiguous 
between =chu and =cha were excluded from t he count of tokens and from the 
analysis presented here.  
Both on verbal and nominal hosts, =chu most often indicates the polar interrogative 
meaning. Consider:  
(3.53) polar interrogative =chu on a verbal host 
Riku-ngui=chu       Jacobo?   Pi=ta=y ? 
see  -2     =chu       NAME    who=ta=y 
‘Do you see, Jacobo? Who is that?’  
el_16082013_01    016

‘What...[are they] men, or are they hitting [hands] there amongst women?’ 
el_16082013_01    017 
 
However, not all =chu-marked utterances are meant to elicit an answer from the 
addressee. The enclitic often expresses doubt or lack of knowledge. Agai n, this is the 
case for its occurrences on both verbal and nominal hosts:  
 
174 
 
(3.55) dubitative =chu on a nominal host 
ushi=chu         /=cha       shamu-w-n...

el_24092014_03   47

‘Like this a little bit, is [she] making a braid, or searching for lice, or what, to be true, 
I don’t know…’ 
el_16082013_02   044 
 
The utterances expressing doubt, as illustrated by (3.55), can be marked with either 
=chu or the dubitative enclitic =cha (see Section 3.3.2.7). Moreover, as shown in 
(3.56), in cases where =chu-marked utterances do not have an interrogative 
illocutionary force, the enclitic often co-occurs with the particles imacha or imachari 
(what=cha/=chari) (see Sections 3.3.2.7 and 3.3.2.8, respectively). Note that =chu 
can be used dubitatively, independently of t he speaker’s source of information (see 
Section 5.3.4). 
In one case in the elicited discourse corpus, =chu occurred on a nominal host to mark 
negation: 
(3.57)  
pera  ni-shka=m...            pera=chu...     palta   ni-shka-ra       
pear   say   -ANT=mi     pear =chu    avocado  say   -ANT   -ACC

‘[the  fruit] called pear...it's not a pear![the fruit] called avocado, he is cutting [it] 
going up’ 
el_21092014_02   04 
 
175 
 
The example above is a case of self -correction, uttered when describing the Pear 
Story (Chafe 1980). Note that it is very rare in TK to express negation only with the 
enclitic =chu, without the negativ e particle mana. The reverse – mana occurring 
without =chu – is frequent. It could therefore be concluded that in (3.57) the negative 
particle has been elided, since =chu alone does not carry a negative meaning.   
Of the occurrences of =chu on verbal hosts, 22% (n=5) occurred in negative clauses. 
The remaining tokens occurred in interrogative constructions or affirmative clauses 
expressing doubt. Consider the example below, where =chu is used to delimit the 
scope of negation: 
(3.58)  
Randi     kay     churi=ga       mana... mana  apa-shka=chu. 
rather     P.DEM  son    =ga    NEG     NEG take  -ANT=chu 
‘The boy, on the other hand, [he] didn’t….didn’t take [the watch].’ 
el_05122014_02   011 
In the naturalistic discourse co rpus, where =chu occurs in the negative construction 
with the particle mana (n = 90), the enclitic occurs almost exclusively on verbal 
hosts. It was attested to co -occur with present, past and future tense marking. The 
enclitic’s co -occurrence with the FUT  marker -nga requires further investigation, 
given that the constructions involving -nga and =chu seem to signalled 
conditionality or potentiality, rather than future time reference.  
Only three cases of the co -occurrence of =chu and mana in the same claus e were 
attested in the 11h corpus, where =chu did not attach to a verb. O ne was an  
occurrence of the enclitic in the expression mana ima=s=chu (lit. ‘it’s noth ing’, 
meaning ‘you’re welcome’/ ‘don’t mention it’), and two were occurrences on an 
adverbial host, as in (3.59) below: 
(3.59)  
‘mana  yapa=chu  liba-sha         iña-ngui’  ni-sha,    ñuka-ra

‘“You’ve grown up not being punished much”, my mother who raised me used to tell 
me off.’ 
in_01082013_05   295 
The enclitic =chu also occurs in prohibitive construction s, where it co-occurs with 
the prohibitive particle ama. In the 11h of the naturalistic discourse corpus, 32 
examples were found of the ama + =chu construction. In all these cases, =chu 
occurred on a verbal host: 
(3.60) = (2.99)  
Shami,  ama   mandza-y=chu ! 
come  PROH  fear-2SG.IMP=chu 
‘Come, don’t be afraid!’ 
in_20092013_03   298 
In the elicited discourse corpus, =chu was also attested on adverbs (n=3) and 
particles (n=2). The adverbial occurrences of the enclitic were in dubitative and 
interrogative contexts, but (3.59) above shows that =chu also occurs on adverbials in 
negative clauses. On particles, both tokens of the enclitic occurred on the negative 
mana. It seems that in TK the collocation mandzu (mana=chu) functions as a 
discourse marker with a function similar to that of the English  ‘you know’ or ‘isn’t 
it’, depending on the context:  
(3.61)  
Chi,       ñuka    ñankarta  rimawni   mandzu,      imasna

el_16082013_01    176 
 
177 
 
The marker =chu can co -occur with the additive =pas, the limitative =lla and the 
‘identity of reference’ =llara, always attaching outside them. It  can also co -occur 
with the emphatic marker =y, which, in turn, attaches outside =chu. In one case in 
the corpus, =chu co-occurred with both =y and =guti, with =guti attaching outside 
both other markers. It was shown by the corpus analysis and confirmed in  elicitation 
that the enclitic =chu cannot co-occur on the same host with the enclitics =ga, =mi, 
=ma or =mari, =tá or =ta. It also does not co -occur on the same host with =cha or 
=chari, but in certain discourse contexts these three markers occur in free variation. 
The enclitic was not attested to co -occur on the same host with =ri, but the co -
occurrence restrictions of the two markers were not investigated in elicitation. 
On the basis of the preliminary auditory and pitch contour analysis of 40 tokens of 
=chu encountered in the elicited discourse corpus, I concluded that the enclitic 
optionally partakes in lexical stress assignment. It altered the lexical stress 
assignment in ca. 33% of the cases (n=14).  
To sum up, the TK =chu is a polar interrogative and  negation marker. In negative 
clauses, it co-occurs with the negative particle mana and the prohibitive ama, which 
carry the negative meaning, while =chu is used to delimit the scope of negation. The 
enclitic occurs with all types of hosts in the interroga tive contexts, and shows strong 
preference for verbal hosts in negative constructions. It is compatible with verbs in 
the indicative as well as imperative mood. It marks the focus of polar questions, and 
is incompatible on the same host with other focus -marking enclitics. It optionally 
affects the lexical stress assignment of its hosts.  
3.3.2.7 =cha 
In current analyses of Quechuan languages, the cognates of the TK =cha have most 
often been analysed as validational (e.g. Adel aar 1977; Cole 1982) , 
conjectural/inferential evidential  (e.g. Weber 1986; Floyd 1997) , or both indirect 
evidential and a weak epistemic modal (e.g. Faller 2002) . The TK =cha does n ot 
seem to correlate with indirect evidence types, although preliminary analysis shows 
that it does occur in contexts where the speaker admits the =cha-marked proposition 
as a possibility. The epistemic/evidential meaning of the TK =cha is discussed in 
detail in Section 5.3.4. In TK, the marker has two allomorphs: [d͡ ʒa] after nasals and 
[t͡ ʃa] in all other contexts. It seems that from the previous analyses, the one which fits 
 
178 
 
most closely with the use of the TK =cha is in line with the analysis provided by 
Cusihuáman (1976/2001) for Cuzco Quechua (QI I). He claimed that in CQ, =cha 
expresses doubt, uncertainty or conjecture when occurying on interrogative words, 
and epistemic possibility when occurying on non -interrogative words (Cusihuamán 
1976/2001: 233-4). As shown in the examples below, this distinction does not seem 
to hold for TK.  
There were 33 tokens of =cha in th e 2h elicited discourse corpus. However, their 
distribution was heavily biased towards the occurrence of the marker on the 
interrogative pronoun ima (‘what’). Therefore, the naturalistic discourse corpus was 
also examined, where further 141 tokens of the m arker were attested. Table 3.8 
shows the distribution of the tokens of =cha from the entire corpus, with the 
occurrences in the elicited discourse corpus given in brackets:

Table 3.8 shows that over 50% of the tokens of =cha in the corpus occurs on 
pronominal hosts. However, the majority of the pronominal hosts of =cha are 
interrogative pronouns. The enclitic occurs most often on the interrogative ima 
(‘what’). The occurrences on that pronoun alone make for more than one third (n=60) 
of all the tokens of =cha in the corpus:

The collocation ima=cha, sometimes also affixe d with the interrogative =y (see 
Section 3.3.2.10), occurs both in interrogative clauses, as in (3.63), and in affirmative 
clauses, where it indicates doubt on the part of the speaker, as in (3.62). In both cases, 
however, they collocation is not the only interrogative/dubitative element in the 
clause. This, together with the frequency of the collocation, suggests that 
ima=cha(=y) might be becoming lexicalised as an epist emic tag question, or an 
epistemic discourse marker. In Section 3.3.2.8 I discuss a collocation of ima with the 
enclitic =chari, which seems to serve a similar discourse function.  
The data show that the meaning of =cha is similar to the interrogative meaning of 
=chu, discussed in Section 3.3.2.6. Similarly to =chu, =cha, independently of the 
type of its host, occurs in polar questions, and in affirmative clauses expressing doubt 
on the part of the speaker. Like =chu, =cha is felicitous in polar questions, but not in 
content questions.

Example (3.65) comes from an interview. While the participant in the recording 
uttered pi=cha (who=cha), the transcriber suggested that it was a slip of a tongue, 
since =cha is not felicitous in the context of a content question. Rather, he suggested 
that the participant shou ld have used the content question marker =ta (see Section 
3.3.2.9). The corpus data confirm that observation. The enclitic =cha, again like 
=chu, occurs on different types of hosts in interrogative contexts, dep ending on the 
focus of the polar question. The marker occurs on both finite and non -finite verbal 
hosts; Example (3.64) above shows the enclitic occurring on an infinitive verb.  
Like the markers discussed in th e previous sections, =cha occurs on the heads of 
nominal and pronominal phrases. The example below illustrates the occurrence of 
=cha on personal pronouns:  
(3.66)  
Pay =cha   Karolina ? 
3SG=cha  NAME 
‘So she is Karolina?’/ ‘She must be Karolina?’ 
in_20092013_03   347 
In (3.66), =cha occurs on the prosodically marked interrogative. As discussed above, 
the enclitic is infelicitous in content questions. However, =cha can attach to 
interrogative pronouns used in content qu estions. In such cases, the =cha-marked 
clauses are not interpreted as having an interrogative illocutionary force, but rather as 
rhetorical questions:  
(3.67)  
may=ta=cha      ri-n,   karu  rin 
where=ta =cha   go-3  far go-3 
‘where can he be going, he is going far..’ 
in_07062013_01    181 
The above applies to occurrences o f =cha not only on interrogative pronouns, but 
also on other types of hosts. Consider:  
 
 
181 
 
(3.68)  
Ima shuti-ra=cha,  Shangri=cha  ni-j-kuna           a-ka=y,

‘That one, what kind of manioc is that (I don’t know)…’ 
in_01082013_06   098 
In both (3.68) and (3.69) =cha co-occurs in the same clause with a range o f other 
markers, namely =chu, =chari and =y. Example (3.69) shows =cha and =y 
occurring on the same host. Both examples are of rhetorical questions, with the 
speaker ‘thinking aloud’ to mark uncertainty with regard to the =cha-marked content 
of the proposition expressed. The data shown above indicate that the TK =cha seems 
to be used to express uncertatinty on the part of the speaker, and that it tends to occur 
on focal consituents  of polar questions . Unlike =chu, =cha does not partake in 
negation (see Section 4.5.4).  
As shown in the examples above, =cha can co -occur on the same host with the 
interrogative marker =y. It cannot occur on the same host as =chu or =chari (see 
Section 3.3.2.6) and in certain contexts seems to be in complementary distribution 
with those markers. While =y always attaches outside =cha, the marker can also co -
occur with =lla, =llara, and =pas (one occurrence in the corpus) attaching to their 
right. The issues pertinent to the co-occurrence of =cha and =ri on the same host are 
discussed in more detail in Section 3.3.2.15.  
The preliminary auditory and pitch c ontour analysis of the tokens of =cha from both 
parts of the corpus suggests that the enclitic  can, but does not have to, affect the 
 
182 
 
lexical stress assignment of its host. The lexical stress was affected by roughly one in 
four of the examined occurrences of =cha.  
To sum up, the enclitic =cha functions as a dubitative and polar question marker, but, 
unlike the other polar question enclitic =chu, it does not partake in negative or 
imperative constructions. In certain discourse contexts, it occurs in compleme ntary 
distribution with =chu and =chari. It co -occurs on the same host with several other 
TK enclitics: =lla, =llara, =pas, =y and =ri. It often co-occurs with the interrogative 
pronoun ima (‘what’), in a collocation which seems to be on its way to lexicalisation 
as an epistemic discourse marker. The enclitic optionally affects the lexical stress 
assignment of its host.  
3.3.2.8 =chari 
In previous studies of Quechuan =chari was glossed as an emphatic version of the 
inferential evidential/dubitative marker =cha (cf. e.g. Floyd 1997; Faller 2002) . 
However, as was also the case with the =mi/=mari pair, the aforementioned studies 
do not explain how the ‘emphatic’ meaning of the marker arises. Accordin g to the 
TK data , both =cha and =chari seem to indicate that the speaker admits 
theproposition marked with those enclitics as a possibility ( see Section  4.5.4). The 
enclitic =chari was analysed as dubitative in a pedagogical grammar of Tena Kichwa 
(Mújica & Goldáraz 2010), which, to my knowledge, is the only Tena Kichwa 
primer written in the recent years . Nonetheless, the authors mention the enclitic very 
briefly, only giving one example.  
There were only 16 tokens of =chari in the ‘elicited discourse’ part of the corpus. Of 
those, the majority (n=14) occurred on the interrogative pronoun ima (‘what’), while 
the rem aining two occurred on nouns. F urther 74 o ccurrences were found in the 
naturalistic discourse corpus. The distribution of the tokens from both parts of the 
corpus is shown in Table 3.9, with the numbers of tokens from the ‘elicited discourse’ 
corpus shown in brackets.

Almost half of the ocurrences of =chari in both parts of the corp us occurred on 
pronouns. Furthermore, one third of the total number of tokens (n=30) occured on 
the interrogative pronoun ima (‘what’), in a collocation analogous to that of ima and 
=cha (see Section 3.3.2.7). Consider the following examples:

el_05122014_01   020 
In both (3.70) and (3.71), as well as in all the other occurrences of imachari in the 
corpus, the collocation s are preceded by a constituent affixed with o ne of the TK 
question markers. Therefore, we can conclude that imachari functions as a ‘tag 
question’. In none of the examples did the interrogative pronoun ima index a missing 
 
184 
 
argument of the interrogative clause. This, however, is not the case where =chari 
occurs on other interrogative pronouns: 
(3.72)  
Panira   mulistakpis         mamama        rimak   ashka

ta_07062013_02    301 
In (3.72), the interrogative pronoun marked  with =chari stands for the missing 
argument of the interrogative clause, which differentiates this use of the enclitic from 
those shown in (3.70) and (3.71).  
On verbal hosts, =chari occurs on nominalised, non -finite and finite verb forms. On 
nominal hosts, similarly t o the other enclitics described so far, =chari was only 
attested on phrasal heads.  On hosts other than pronouns, the marker occurs not only 
in interrogative clauses, but also in constructions describing potential or non -
actualised events. Consider:

In (3.74) the ‘non -actualised’ interpretation arises by virtue of the presence of the 
future/irrealis marker -nga (see Section 2.4.2.2.4). However, this is not the case in 
(3.73), where only anterior marker -shka is present. This indicates that the presence 
of =chari might be related to the lack of existential closure (see Section 5.3.2). In the 
corpus, there are eight occurrences of =chari on verbal hosts with the FUT -nga, all 
of which render a ‘non-actualised’ reading:   
(3.75)  
Cedula-ra   chari-ngui=chari  kan=ga ?

in_20092013_03   110 
However, when attaching to verbs with present and time reference, =chari can occur 
in clauses denoting actualised events . In the corpus, =chari was not attested on 
verbal hosts with past tense marker -ka.  
 
186 
 
On the basis of the above examples, and taking into account that the 13h corpus only 
comprises 90 tokens of the marker, the meaning of =chari is still difficult to define.  
It seems that, rather that contributing to the truth-conditional content of a proposition, 
=chari indicates the speaker’s epistemic evaluation of it. The semantics of =chari is 
discussed in more detail in Section 5.4.2). 
The preliminary auditory an d pitch contour examination of 56 tokens of =chari 
suggests that the enclitic’s participation in lexical stress assignment is optional. The 
occurrence of =chari did not affect lexical stress in 37.5% of the cases (n=21). 
Interestingly, out of 22 examined occurrences of =chari on the interrogative pronoun 
ima (‘what’), only one did not shift the lexical stress pattern of the host ('i. ma.cha.ri 
rather than i.ma'cha.ri), which strengthens the hypothesis that the collocation might 
be undergoing a process of grammaticalisation into a discourse particle.  
To summarise, =chari is an enclitic which occurs on hosts from all major TK phrasal 
categories and shows few co -occurrence restrictions with verbal and nominal 
inflection markers. Like the other markers described  so far, it occurs on phrasal 
heads. It has not been attested to co -occur on the same host with any of the di scourse 
markers discussed in this chapter. It optionally participates in stress assignment.  
3.3.2.9 =ta 
The enclitic =ta is an interrogative  marker occurring in content questions . It  is a 
possible cognate of the contrastive marker  -taq described e.g. for Cuzco  Quechua 
(QII, cf. e.g. Cusihuamán 1976 /2001: 240; S ánchez 2010:  35). In the elicited 
discourse corpus, 86% of the tokens of =ta occurred on interrogative pronouns. 
Consequently, tokens of =ta were also extracted from the 11h naturalistic discourse 
corpus. Since the naturalistic discourse corpus is not ful ly parsed and glossed, it was 
possible to mine it for =ta occurring in certain environments, but not to extract all of 
the tokens. The marker’s allophones – the post -vocalic [ ɾa], [da]  occurring after 
nasals, and [ta] in all other environments – are homophonous to the allophones of the 
accusative -ta, and the corpus contained over 11,000 lexical items in which the final 
syllable was [ta], [ɾa] or [da].  
Due to the above  considerations, Table 3.10 shows the distribution of the  tokens of 
=ta in the elicited discourse corpus: 
 
187

As evident from Table 3.10, the distribution of =ta in the elicited discourse corpus is 
heavily biased towards its occurrence on pronouns. Moreover, all the pronominal 
hosts of =ta were interrogative pronouns. The marker occurred 11 times on the 
interrogative particle ima, in combination with various other markers, including case 
marking and the emphatic =y (see Section 3.3.2.10). Judging from distributional 
evidence, the collocation ima=ta(=y), similarly to ima=cha(=y) and ima=chari, (see 
Sections 3.3.2.7 and 3.3.2.8, respectively), often functions as a discourse connective 
similar to the English ‘I dunno’/’you know’, rather than as an interrogative pronoun: 
(3.77)  
Timbra-jpi=mari,       ima=ra=y.....maska-n.    Pay   celular         shina-kpi   
sound-SWREF=mari what=ta=y    look.for-3  3SG  mobile.phone   like.this-SWREF

‘When [the phone] rings, what’s it, [he] looks, his phone doesn’t do…what’s it called 
[stop], so he pushes the woman again [touches her on the arm seeking attention].’ 
el_05122014_01   040 
In the example above, coming from a description of a video stimulus, the pronoun 
ima, marked with =ta, does not correspond to a missing argument of an interrogative 
clause, but rather seems to be an exp ressive or discourse -linking device. However, 
ima can also co -occur with =ta in content questions where it replaces the missing 
argument, often with appropriate case marking. In those cases, the occurrence of =ta 
on ima (‘what’) has a similar function to i ts occurences on other interrogative 
pronouns:

‘Who could/would  she love, her?’ 
el_15102014_01   83 
In both (3.78) and (3.79), the interrogative pronouns which serve as hosts for =ta are 
the missing argument  in the interrogative clause.33 The occurrence of =ta is not 
restricted to ProPs. In (3.80), it occurs on the head of an NP:  
(3.80)  
ima   tunu=ra ? 
what  manner =ta 
‘how (lit. in what way) is this [possible]?’ 
el_03102014_01   049 
The marker only occurrs on nominal hosts twice in the elicited discourse corpus, 
both times in content questions. In the unglossed part of the corpus, the occurrence of 
=ta on nouns is not readily distinguishable from accusative marking. Nonetheless, 
the occur rences of =ta on nouns seem infrequent, which is compatible with its 
‘content question marker’ analysis.  
In the ‘elicited discourse’ corpus =ta was only attested once on a nominalised verbal 
host, but it also occurred on nominalised, non -finite and finite  verbs in the 
naturalistic discourse corpus. In (3.81), it attaches to a finite verbal host: 
                                                 
33 Note that there is an idiosyncrasy in how the ACC -ta is realised in (3.78) and (3.79). In both cases 
the marker follows [i], but it is realised as [ɾa] in t he first case, and [ta] in the second. The same 
idiosyncrasy applies to =ta when occurring after [i]. After monosyllabic hosts ending in [i] (e.g. pi 
‘who’, chi ‘D.DEM’, kay ‘P.DEM’), both markers are realised as [ɾa]. On disyllabic hosts, such as 
(may-bi ‘where-LOC’, pani ‘sister.of.male’), both markers are realised as [ta]. At present, I cannot 
account for this idiosyncrasy.

The marker is often attested in non -verbal and complex verbal predicates. In these 
contexts, similarly to (3.81) above, it tends to co -occur with the e mphatic non-
declarative =y (see Section 3.3.2.10). While =ta occurs on the main verb/predicate, 
=y attaches to the AUX or COP: 
(3.82)  
Imarangay?

el_22102014_01   013 
Example (3.83) shows that in rapid speech, when occurying on complex predicates, 
=ta can be realised as a proclitic on the AUX.  The enclitic =ta was also attested on 
an adverbial host:  
 
 
190 
 
(3.84)

‘There, a man, [he] was listening to music, was that so?’ 
el_05122014_01   008 
The utterance quote d in (3.84) is part of a dialogue in which two consu ltants 
separately watched near -identical videos and were asked to compare them. The 
speaker in (3.84) presents the plot of the video he watched, a nd uses the  
demonstrative adverbial 34 shina (‘like.this’) with interrogative morphology to elicit 
confirmation. The co -occurrence of of =ta on the adverbial shina requires a closer 
investigation (see also discussion of shina in Section 3.3.2.12). In all other contexts, 
=ta functions as a content question marker, while in collocation with shina it occurs 
in yes/no questions, seeking confirmation. This could perhaps be explained by the 
fact that shinara(y) seems to be a collocation  the meaning of which has shifted from 
the original meanings of its parts.  
Finally, it is prudent to mention that =ta is not required for the grammaticality of any 
of the examples given above. Content questions without =ta are used very often in 
everyday discourse, but in careful speech, or in elicitation, they are almost always 
uttered with =ta. In the corpus, =ta co-occurred on the same host with =y, and was 
only attested once in a cluster with both =y and =ri. It was not attested on the same 
host with a ny of the other markers discussed in this chapter. In terms of its 
phonological properties, =ta is ambiguous between a suffix and a clitic. Preliminary 
auditory and pitch contour examination of 40 tokens of =ta has shown that it does 
not affect the stress pattern of its host in just over a half (n=21) of the cases. 
In sum, =ta is a content question enclitic. It was attested in the corpus to occur on 
hosts from several phrasal categories, always attaching to the head, but not always

immediately on the right edge of the phrase . It attaches outside all inflectional 
morphology, and often co -occurs on the same host with the emphatic interrogative 
enclitic =y, which attaches outside =ta. It optionally participates in the lexical stress 
assignment of its host. 
3.3.2.10 =y 
The enclitic =y is, to my knowledge, not attested in other varieties of Quechua. It is 
also relatively infrequent in TK; 28 tokens were attested in the ‘elicited discourse’ 
corpus. Extracting all the occurrences of =y in the ‘naturalistic discourse’ corpus 
proved impossible at this stage, since the corpus is not fully parsed and glossed. The 
corpus contains 3122 [y] -final words, and the enclitic = y is homophonous with an 
allomorph of the LOC case marker and with the 2 SG.IMP marker. Nonetheless, 
preliminary conclusions about the properties of =y can be reached on the basis of the 
available data. The distribution of =y with different types of hosts is shown in Table 
3.11.

As shown in Table 3.11, 68% of the tokens of =y occurred on pronominal hosts . All 
of these were on interrogative pronouns, and almost 70% (n=13) – on ima (‘what’), 
always in collocation either with the dubitative/polar question marker  =cha, as in  
(3.85), or with the content question marker =ta, as in (3.86):

The properties of the collocation imacha were described in Section 3.3.2.7, where I 
concluded that it might be in the process of universalisation into an epistemic 
discourse marker. The data suggests that the same conclusion could be applied to 
imara (what=ta), which, both with and without the enclitic =y, expresses doubt or  
hesitation on the part of the speaker.  
In the six cases where =y occurred on a pronominal host other than ima, it also 
always occurred on the same host with either =cha, as in (3.85) above, or =ta, as in 
(3.87) and (3.88):

el_28112014_06   001 
As shown in Table 3.11, =y was attested only once on a nominal host, and once on a 
discourse particle. In both cases, it co-occurred with the content question marker =ta: 
 
 
193

The example above comes from an elicitation task in which one of the consultants 
had to describe to the other how to order the cards depicting animals. The speaker 
hesitated when describing the anim als to her interlocutor, and immediately uttered a 
self-correction, using interrogative marking and =y.  
In the naturalistic discourse corpus,  =y was also attested on a predicate adjective, 
again in an interrogative clause. In this case, it co -occurred on the same host with the 
polar question/negation marker =chu (see Section 3.3.2.6): 
(3.90)  
Kam-ba   churi-wa=s   atun=lla=chu=y ? 
2SG-GEN  son-DIM=pas  big  =lla=chu=y 
‘Is your son also big [already]?’ 
ta_07062013_01    131 
Note that =y also co -occurs with =chu in the only non-interrogative contexts in 
which it was attested in the corpus. Consider:  
(3.91)  
Ama  mandzarichichuyguti! 
ama   mandza-ri          -ychi       =chu      =y=guti  
PROH  fear      -ANTIC-2PL.IMP=Q/NEG=y=guti 
‘Don’t be afraid!’ 
ev_29082013_01c 010 
In (3.92), on the other hand, =y occurs together with =chu in a hypothetical  
construction:  
 
 
194 
 
(3.92)  
Allpara  mikuna  sami  ajpichuy,   lumuwa=lla-ra

in_01082013_02 037 
The English transla tion of (3.92) does not convey its meaning very well – in TK 
discourse, the verbs affixed with =chu=y seem to convey a negative rhetorical 
question meaning. In both of the above examples, the semantic contribution of  =y to 
the clause seems to consist in reinforcing the meanings of =chu. Constructions 
exemplified in (3.91) and (3.92) are infrequent in the corpus and require further 
investigation based on more data.  
Seven tokens of =y were attested on verbal hosts, five of which co -occurred with the 
future marker -nga. Consider: 
(3.93) = (3.83) = (3.2) 
chi-manda=ga,           may-ta         ri-na=ra   a-nga=y

P.DEM  cow  stand-ANT -ABL  =ga 
‘From there, where does one need to go, from [this place] where the cow is standing? ’ 
el_22102014_01   013 
In (3.93), =y co-occurs on the same host with the future marker -nga, and within the 
same complex verb construction with the interrogative =ta. The suffix -nga conveys 
a future tense meaning, and can also be used to present hypothetical/non -actualised 
events (see Section 2.4.2.2.4). This is the case in (3.93) where, while p erforming a 
map task, the consultant is asking her partner for instructions, and the proposition can 
be interpreted as having an epistemic modal meaning. Similar epistemic modal 
 
195 
 
interpretation applies to all other cases of the co -occurrence of -nga with =y in the 
corpus. Nontheless, =y was also attested in modally unmarked interrogatives: 
(3.94)  
Ukllari-k          shamu-n,       imasna=ra   kapari-ka=y  ?

‘[she/he] comes, hugging [the other person]...what did [he/she] shout?’ 
el_16082013_01    072 
The consultant uttered (3.94) after watching one of the Max Planck reciprocal stimuli 
videos, in which two people were patting each other’s back, saying ‘hello’ (cf. Evans, 
Levinson & Enfield 2004) . Here, the marker =y co-occurs with the content question 
marker =ta not on the same host, but within the same VP. The enclitic =y was also 
attested to co-occur on verbal hosts with the SS marker -sha: 
(3.95)  
kuna  kay   maytu-ra  ima-y=ra   wakachi-sha=y? 
now P.DEM maito-ACC what-LOC=ta  guard    -COR=y 
‘now where do I store this maito (traditional dish)?’ 
in_20092013_02   100 
The enclitic co -occurred with -sha only in interrogative and rhetorical question 
contexts. In (3.95), =y again co-occurred within the same VP with the interrogative 
=ta.  
Most of the tokens of =y analysed above occurred in interrogative or quasi -
interrogative contexts. It was also attested in imperatives, attach ing outside the 
marker =chu. When co -occurring on the same host with other interrogative/  
dubitative enclitics: =cha, =chu and =ta, =y always attaches outside them. It shows 
no co -occurrence restrictions with tense marking. Apart from its occurrence in 
rhetorical questions, =y was not attested in declarative clauses. Where it occurs, =y 
reinforces the meaning of the markers it co-occurs with, reinforcing the interrogative, 
imperative or hypothetical meaning of the clause. More detailed study of the marker 
should be undertaken in future, but the currently available data suggest that =y is a 
 
196 
 
non-declarative emphatic marker. The nature of the emphasis that it adds to 
utterances is also left to be established by future research. 
Assessing the impact of the encli tic on the lexical stress assignment is problematic, 
since in most cases encountered in the corpus (n=21) it occurs in clitic clusters with 
=chu, =cha, and =ta, following all of the aforementioned enclitics. Since the other 
markers consist of a full syllab le, they are most likely responsible for the shift in 
stress assignment of the host, where it occurs. Examination of the examples from 
both parts of the corpus, where =y was the only enclitic occurring on the host, 
showed that in none of these cases did it  affect stress. Only about 15 such 
occurrences were examined, but a preliminary conclusion can be reached that =y 
does not affect the lexical stress assignment of its host.   
In sum, =y is a non -declarative emphatic marker, which tends to attach outside 
enclitics =chu, =cha and =ta and generally follows the distributional patterns of 
those enclitics. It was also attested to co -occur with the limitative marker =lla and – 
once – with the additive =pas. It has no effect on the lexical stress assignment of its 
host.   
3.3.2.11 =lla 
The marker =lla is present in other varieties of Quechua (cf. e.g. Cole 1982; 
Cusihuamán 2001; Faller 2002) . For Cuzco (QII), it has been glossed as ‘limitative’  
(e.g. Cusihuamán 1976/2001; Calvo Pérez 1993; Faller 2002), and for Imbabura (QII) 
– as ‘just’ (Cole 1982). Its meaning in other Quech uan languages is similar to the 
meaning of the TK =lla.  
Compared to other markers described in this chapter, =lla is relatively frequent in the 
TK corpus. Its distribution with hosts from di fferent word classes in the 2h ‘elicited 
discourse’ corpus is shown in Table 3.12:

Table 3.12 shows that =lla occurs on all major TK parts of speech, being most 
frequent on nouns, pronouns and verbs. Unlike other markers described in this 
chapter, it also occurs on attributive adjectives, which do not function as phrasal 
heads. Another important difference between =lla and the other markers described in 
this chapt er is that, while the other markers always attach outside inflectional 
morphology, =lla behaves morphologically more like a suffix, in that it can attach 
either inside, or outside inflectional morphology. Consider:

In (3.96) =lla occurs word-finally on a fully inflected verb in the imperative mood. 
In (3.97) it attaches to a nominal host, but it occurs to the left of the INSTR -wa 
indicating the adjunct status of the NP. This shows that =lla precedes case and case-
like inflection on nominal hosts, but occurs in a more prototypical clitics position on 
verbal hosts, where it attaches outside the derivational and inflectional morpholo gy. 
The reasons for such distributions of the marker remain to be investigated.

Auditory and pitch contour examination of 104 tokens of =lla shows that, in almost 
all cases, =lla is fully integrated into the stress pattern of its hosts. Out of the 104 
tokens, 27 were mono-syllabic hosts, in which case the occurrence of =lla could not 
affect the penultimate stress pattern. Out of the remaining 77 examples, =lla behaved 
phonologically like a suffix in 71 cases. Out of the 6 cases in which =lla did not 
participate in stress assignment, it attached at the right edge of the word in five cases, 
and in one, it was followed by the accusative marker. The cases of =lla which are not 
integrated into the lexical stress patterns of its host constitute a small fraction o f its 
total occurrences. Therefore, I hypothesise that these cases are due to some 
additional factors, which have not been investigated in this study. On the whole, 
however, it can be concluded that phonologically =lla tends to behave like a suffix.  
Particles which, like =lla, attach to hosts from different grammatical classes without 
affecting their class membership, and which either precede or follow inflectional 
morphology, while phonologically behaving like suffixes, have been called multi -
based suffixes (cf. Nikolaeva 2014: 126), or mesoclitics (cf. Spencer & Luis 2012). I 
adopt the latter term to refer to =lla.  
As mentioned above, on nominal hosts =lla follows derivational morphology and 
number, but precedes both semantic and syntactic case, as in (3.97) above. The same 
applies to its occurrence on pronominal hosts: 
(3.98)

el_25092014_02   097 
When attaching to nominals in subject function, which occur in the zero -marked 
nominative case, =lla tends to occur word -finally, as in (3.99), unless it is followed 
by one of the free enclitics, as in (3.100):

The examples given so far show that the meaning of =lla is not semantically uniform 
across its occurences. On nouns and personal pronouns (examples (3.96) and (3.99), 
respectively), it tends to encode unique reference (only x and nothing else). However, 
on locative pronouns, it can have either the unique reference meaning, as in (3.100), 
or a meaning akin to that of English ‘just’, meaning ‘exactly’ or ‘precisely’ as in 
(3.98). On adjectival and adverbial hosts, =lla encodes a kind of diminutive or 
emphatic meaning:  
(3.101)

Example (3.101) shows that, unlike any of the markers described so far in this 
chapter, =lla can occur on nominal  modifiers, and hence is not restricted to phrasal 
heads. It also suggest s that the semantics of =lla differs depending on whether it 
occurs on the dependent or on the head of the NP. Compare (3.101) with (3.103):  
(3.103)

in_05092014_01   022-23 
Example (3.103) shows that when occurring on nominal heads, =lla encodes unique 
reference, and , as mentioned above,  on modifiers within the NP, it has a sort of 
diminutive meaning. While on adjectives =lla has a diminutive meaning across the 
corpus, its meaning is less uniform on head nouns. Consider:  
(3.104)  = (3.37) 
Kariwnallas   pacha   apayawna 
kari  -guna=lla  =pas       pacha   apaya -guna

‘[The] young men, gosh, [the] guys pass by, eating…’ 
el_25092014_03   069 
In (3.104), =lla encodes a diminutive/emphatic meaning, despite occurr ing on the 
nominal head. The lack of the ‘unique reference’ meaning is, in this case, confirmed 
 
201 
 
by the co -occurrence of =lla with the additive =pas. The syntactic and discourse 
contexts in which =lla expresses a diminutive/emphatic meaning despite occurrin g 
on a head noun need further investigation.  
When occurring on verbal hosts, =lla attaches to the right edge of the word, 
following the tense and agreement morphology, but preceding any other enclitics 
attaching to the same host. The limitative marker occ urs on both non-finite and finite 
verbs. In both contexts, it can either encode the meanings of unique reference, or a 
meaning of emphasis. Consider: 
(3.105)  
riku-sha=lla          pasa-n        chi    churi-wa...

‘The man is there for nothing, he doesn't do a thing…’ 
el_05122014_01   078 
Example (3.105) above is a description of the final scene of the Pear Story (Chafe 
1980). The narrator was expecting that the farmer would capture the boy, but the boy 
has only passed by, undisturbed. In (3.106), the unique reference meaning does not 
apply, and =lla seems to rather add a meaning of emphas is, drawing attention to the 
subordinate clause it marks. Similar idiosyncrasy applies to the occurrences of the 
marker on finite verbs — see (3.96) above. In cases like (3.96) and (3.106), =lla 
could potentially be analysed as encoding a meaning similar to that of the English 
‘just’, ambiguous between limitative and emphatic.   
The mesoclitic =lla co-occurs with several enclitics discussed in this chapter, namely 
with =mi, =ma, =mari, =chu, =cha, =pas, =tá, =y and =guti. It always attaches to 
their left. It was not attested with any of the other markers, but their co -occurrence 
restrictions were not checked in elicitation.  
 
202 
 
In sum, the marker =lla is a mesoclitic, that is, it can attach both inside and outside 
inflectional morphology. It tends to precede case marking on nominals and attach 
word-finally on verbs, though preceding the enclitics with which it co -occurs. Unlike 
any of the other markers describe d so far, it can occur on attributive adjectives. 
Morphophonologically, it behaves like a suffix. Most often it encodes unique 
reference meaning, but it can also express a diminutive meaning, or add general 
emphasis to the clause. It remains to be investigated what insights can be gained with 
respect to the semantic and pragmatic properties of =lla by comparing it with 
distributionally similar limitative markers attested cross -linguistically (see e.g. 
Schultze-Berndt 2002 for an overview of such markers in Australian languages).  
3.3.2.12 =llara 
The marker =llara is, to my knowledge, not described for other Quechuan varieties. 
While it is homophonous with the combination of the limitative / =lla/ and [ ɾa], the 
postvocalic allomorph of the ACC / -ta/ or the interrogative / =ta/, many occurrences 
of [llara] in the corpus cannot be analysed as LIM -ACC or LIM-INTER. I postulate 
=llara to be a separate marker in TK. While it is possible that it emerged from th e 
combination of LIM and ACC marking, diachronic investigation of its origins is 
beyond the scope of this study.  Note that several Quechua varieties exhibit 
combinations of suffixes with semantics similar to that of the TK =llara. In Bolivian 
Quechua varieties, the combination of suffixes -lla-taq, frequently co-occurring with 
the additive -pis, means roughly ‘and that too is the case’ (Howard 2013:17):   
(3.107)  Bolivian Quechua (QII) 
pay-pis  waliq-lla-taq 
she/he-also  fine-just-and  
‘and she/he too is just fine’ 
Howard (2013:17, orginal glossing) 
While in TK =llara does not seem to frequently co -occur with =pas, the semantics 
of -lla-taq in Bolivian Quechua suggests the combination of the two suffixes as a 
likely cognate of the TK =llara. For Huánuco Quechua (QI), Weber  (1989: 510) 
reports a co -occurrence of the -lla (limitative) and -raq (‘still’/’yet’) on the 
lexicalised expression chayllaraj (P.DEM-lla-raq), meaning ‘just a moment ago’ . 
Weber (1989) only gives one example of the co -occurrence of the two markers, 
 
203 
 
hence the possibilities of comparing the Huánuco construction with the TK =llara 
are limited.  
Table 3.13 shows the distribution of the marker’s tokens encountered in the elicited 
discourse corpus with hosts from different grammatical categories:

The naturalistic discourse corpus contained a further 500+ tok ens of the marker. 
While no detail ed distributional study was conducted  on that bigger part of the 
corpus, preliminary observations confirm that the distribution of =llara across both 
parts of the corpus is similar.  
On nominal and pronominal hosts, t he marker =llara could be analysed as encoding  
definite reference by signalling the identity of the referent it marks with a referent 
already given in discourse (see Section 4.3). Consider:  
(3.108)  
Ima,   chi     wawawnallarachu    chima

There they are helping, they themselves [are] filling [the basket with fruit] 
el_25092014_03   051 
Examples above come from descriptions of the Pear Story (Chafe 1980), and in both 
cases the referents of the noun, as in (3.108), and the pronoun, as in (3.109), are 
identical to a referent indicated in previous discourse. Moreo ver, in (3.108) it is that 
very identity that is queried by the interrogative, indicating that =llara contributes 
truth-conditional meaning to the utterance (see Section  4.1.1). As many other 
markers described in this chapter, =llara was only attested to occur on the head of 
the phrase.  
While the ‘identity of reference’ meaning is well -suited to describe the occurrences 
of =llara on nominal hosts, its meaning on verba l hosts is slightly different. Before I 
discuss the semantics of =llara on verbs, however, it  is prudent to mention that  its 
occurrences on verbal hosts are relatively infrequent in both parts of the corpus. As 
shown in Table 3.13, under 12 % of the tokens  of =llara in the elicited discourse 
corpus occurred on verbal hosts. Moreover, in both parts of the corpus, the marker 
does not occur on main verbs, but only on nominalised and subordinate verbal hosts. 
On nominali sed verbs, which function as arguments and adjuncts in the clause, 
=llara has the same semantic effect as on ‘regular’ nominal hosts: 
(3.110)  
pitiwshkamallara                      paktasha, 
piti   -w           -shka -ma    =llara   pakta  -sha

D.DEM-ACC    pass  -3PL.PST  therefore 
‘getting to [the place where he] was cutting, they passed that place, and so...’ 
el_24092014_04   16 
 
205 
 
In (3.110), the Anterior marker -shka is used to form a participle, which in this case 
functions as a locative adjunct. The marker =llara indicates that the relative clause 
refers to the same place which was already evoked in previous discourse.  
On non -nominalised verbal hosts, =llara only co -occurs with the marker -sha, 
indicating action concomitant to that of the main verb (see Section 2.5.3.2.3):  
(3.111)  
chaja    uma     ashallara,   mama  ashallara,  
chaja    uma     a      -sha=llara,  mama   a-sha=llara,

‘[I myself] being silly (lit. being a fox’s head), being a mother, [but] I make you 
study!’ 
in_25052013_1_02   318 
In (3.111) the semantics of both -sha, encoding the same agent as that of the main 
verb, and =llara, encoding reference to a previously mentioned r eferent, converge  
resulting in an emphatic reading of the action being performed by the same agent. 
Discourse contexts in which these two markers are likely to attach to the same host 
remain to be investigated.  
As shown in Table 3.13, =llara most frequently occurs on adverbs. Over 65% (n=30) 
of all the occurrences of the marker on adverbial hosts were on the same adverb: 
shina (like.this). Another 32.5% (n=15) occurred on kuti (again): 
(3.112)  
kuti=llara        shu    ashanga-ma       chura-n...

‘[she] is cutting, cutting...the man is also cutting in the same way’ 
in_24092014_01   022 
In (3.112), the occurrence of =llara on kuti (‘again’) seems to add emphasis  to the 
adverb, which itself encodes a repetition of an action. This is similar to the co -
occurrence of =llara with the COR  suffix -sha in (3.111). In case of the co -
occurrence with  the demonstrative adverb  shina (‘like this’/‘in this way’ ), as  in 
(3.113), =llara encodes reference to some previous instant of the action des cribed by 
the verb modified by shina. The adverb shina (‘like.this’) without the enclitic do es 
not encode such reference. Compare (3.113) with (3.114): 
(3.114)  
kuna  uras=mari  shina   miku-nun 
now time=mari like.this eat-3PL  
‘Nowadays, they eat like this.’  
in_25052013_1_02   091 
The collocation shina=llara can also have a discourse -connective meaning, which 
roughly translates into the English expression ‘by the same token’. In the elicited 
discourse corpus, it was used in this sense only once, and that token was exclud ed 
from the count of adverbial occurrences of the marker. The remaining one 
occurrence of =llara on adverbial hosts was on pariju (‘on.a.par’), the semantics of 
which is similar to shina (‘like.this’).  
Phonologically, =llara behaves like a regular suffix.  Out of the 77 tokens of the 
marker attested in the elicited discourse corpus, it affected the lexical stress 
assignment in 73 cases. The four cases in which it did not bear effect on stress 
assignment were all of personal pronouns used emphatically or con trastively, with 
emphasis on the root of the host. Morphologically, =llara is more clitic-like, since it 
tends to attach outside all inflectional morphology. However, the ordering of =llara 
 
207 
 
with respect to the ACC marker -ta does not seem to be fixed. The examples below 
show the marker attaching to the right (3.115) and to the left (3.116) of the ACC -ta:  
(3.115)

in_20092013_01    093 
In the 11h corpus of naturalistic discourse, =llara precedes the ACC marker four 
times, and attaches outside it six times. In each of the se cases, the co -occurrence of 
the two markers seems not to be restricted to any particular semantic context, 
occurring both with the direct object and the ‘adverbial-deriving’ instances  of the 
ACC. The marker always attaches outside all other case morphology.  
The marker =llara is attested in the corpus on the same host as  many of the other 
markers described in this chapter, namely with the focus marking/epistemic authority 
=mi, the NEG/Q =chu, the dubitative/epistemic =cha, =ma, =mari, the  additive 
=pas, the topic -marker =ga and the emphatic =y. What is interesting is that it co -
occurs both with markers of focus and topic (see Chapter 4). It was not attested to co-
occur with the limitative =lla, =chari, interrogative =ta, verum focus =tá, =ri or 
=guti. Like all of the markers described s o far, except =lla, =llara was only attested 
to occur on phrasal heads. 
 
208 
 
In sum, =llara is a marker encoding identity with a previously used referent, or 
reference to a previously mentioned action. Phonologically, it behaves like a suffix, 
while morphosynta ctically, it is more clitic -like and tends to attach outside 
inflectional morphology, but preceding other enclitics with which it can co -occur. It 
was attested to co-occur with most of the markers discussed in this chapter.  
3.3.2.13 =pas 
The TK enclitic =pas is an additive marker, which has also been reported for other 
varieties of Quechua. Cole (1982) mentions the additive =pash in Imbabura Quechua 
(QII), while for Cuzco Quechua (QII), both Cusihuáman (1976/2001), and Faller 
(2002) describe the allomorphs = pis/=pas. In TK, it has three allomorphs: [s] after 
vowels, [bas] after nasals and [pas] in all the other environments.  
Table 3.14 shows the distribution of =pas in the elicited discourse corpus:

Table 3.14 only takes into account the tokens attested in the elicited discourse corpus. 
Furthermore, 28 tokens of the =pas allomorphs [=pas] and [=bas] were attested  in 
the 11h naturalistic discourse corpus. The tokens of the postvocalic allomorph [=s] 
were not counted, given that the corpus is not entirely glossed and they would have 
to be selected from over 1500 lexical words with final / s/. However, the occurrences 
attested in the elicited discourse corpus allow for an insight into the distributional 
properties and semantics of the marker. While all tokens of = pas can be analysed as 
carrying additive meaning, the details of its semantics seem to differ depending on 
the type of its host. This is shown in the discussion below.  
Over one-third of the marker’s tokens occurred on nominal hosts (n=17). On these 
hosts, =pas can for the most part be interpreted as an additive marker, indicating that 
a given predicate holds for the =pas-marked argument, as well as for another 
argument, mentioned previously, or salient in the discourse context:

When occurring on nominal hosts, the enclitic is often used together with the 
adverbial shina(llara) (like.this=llara ‘as well’/’in the same way ’, see Section 
3.3.2.12), used as a discourse connective. This is the case in (3.118) above, in a 
construction reminiscent of the English also…as well . The enclitic has additive 
meaning also when occurring on personal (3.119) and locative (3.120) pronouns:  
(3.119)

However, when =pas occurs on interrogative pronouns, it acquires a different 
meaning. In declarative clauses, interrogative pronouns which act as hosts for  =pas  
function as free -choice indefinite pronouns (cf. Haspelmath 2013), with a mea nings 
similar to that expressed by the English interrogative pronouns suffixed with -ever:  
(3.121)

When =pas occurs on interrogative pronouns in negative clauses, the free choice 
pronouns acquire a negative polarity reading:  
(3.123)  = (3.106) = (3.28) 
Kay   kari        yanga=mi          tia-n  ima=s   mana   ra-sha=lla...

‘No one has helped [me], not even with one little dollar’ 
in_25052013_2_02   036 
The negative particle mana does not seem to have a fixed position with respect to the 
interrogative pronoun it affects, and can either precede it, as in (3.124), or follow it, 
as in (3.123). The most frequent construction of the type showcased  above is mana 
imas (NEG what=s, ‘[it’s] nothing’), used ubiquitously in everyday discourse, e.g. in  
response to being thanked. Future research on TK  should explore the syntactic and 
semantic properties of occurences of =pas on interrogative pronouns in more detail. 
In the elic ited discourse corpus, seven tokens of =pas occurred on verbal hosts. On 
nominalised verbs, =pas has the same additive meaning as on nominal hosts. 
Consider (3.125), where =pas occurs on a headless relative clause denoting an object 
argument of the matrix clause:  
(3.125)  
 allpama          urmaktas                                      ña           ashangamallara

el_21092014_02   014 
In the examples encountered in the corpus, =pas only occurred three times on finite 
verbs, each time in the main clause of a conditional construction, with =pas affixing 
to the verbal host outside the limitative clitic =lla. In (3.126) below, =pas seems to 
scope over the predi cate, indicating that the subject of the clause performs both the 
action marked with the COR suffix -sha and the action of the main verb, marked 
with =pas. Consider:  
 
212 
 
(3.126)

el_05122014_01   076 
No occurrences of =pas immediately on a finite second person verb were found in 
either part of the corpus. It seems that the use of =lla=pas in this type of conditional 
is conventionalised, but more research is needed into the properties of the TK 
conditionals in general.  
On subordinate verbs, =pas also has an additive meaning:  
(3.127)

‘while also doing [picking the fruit] on the ladder, [he] goes up’  
el_24092014_03   010 
 
I have briefly mentioned in Section 2.5.3.1 that =pas is used to conjoin not only 
arguments or clauses within the same complex sentence, but also different units on 
 
213 
 
the discourse level. More examples and more research are needed to substantiate this 
hypothesis.  
The final type of host on which =pas was attested in both parts of the corpus are 
adverbs. Only one occurrence on an adverbial host was found in the elicited 
discourse corpus, and in the naturalistic discourse corpus =pas occurs several times 
(n=4) on the adverb más (‘more’), borrowed from Spanish. In the se cases, =pas 
expresses a scalar additive meaning, intensifying the meaning of the adverb:  
(3.129)  
ari  shinara   mas  ñawpa  timpu  rukuwna  maspas  yachanun 
ari  shina-ta   mas  ñawpa  timpu  ruku-guna  mas =pas  yacha-nun 
yes, like.this-ACC more before time old-PL  more=pas know-3PL 
‘Yes, exactly, the old people from the older times, they knew even more.’ 
in_13082013_02   246 
While the occurrence of =pas on the adverb más can consistently be interpreted as 
scalar additives akin to the English ‘even’, more res earch is needed into the co -
occurrence of =pas with other types of adverbial hosts.  
The enclitic =pas can co -occur on the same host with several other enclitics 
discussed in this chapter. It was most frequently found co -occurring with the topic 
marker =ga. It also co -occurred with =chu. One instance each of its co -occurrence 
with =mi, =ma and =cha, and = mari was also attested. All of the aforementioned 
enclitics attached outside =pas. The additive enclitic also co -occurs with the 
limitative =lla (see (3.123) and (3.126) above) and the ‘identity of reference’ =llara, 
attaching outside both of the latter. No co -occurrences of =pas with other enclitics 
discussed in this chapter were attested in both parts of the corpus.  
The post-vocalic allomorph [=s] does not affect the stress assignment of the host. For 
the allomorph [=pas], the situation is different, as shown by auditory and pitch 
analysis of the available examples of  [=pas] (n=30). On one -syllable hosts, the 
enclitic does not affect the lexical stress, which remains on the host. This is to be 
expected, since default lexical stress in TK falls on the penultimate syllable. 
However, in case of hosts consisting of two or more syllables (n=16), the lexical 
 
214 
 
stress was shifted by the occurrence of =pas in 11 cases. Therefore, we can conclude 
that =pas optionally affects the lexical stress assignment.  
To sum up, =pas is an additive marker, which can also express meanings such  as 
scalar additivity, and which partakes in constructions deriving free -choice pronouns 
from interrogative pronouns. Like most markers described so far, it was only attested 
to occur on phrasal heads. Out of all the contexts in which it was attested, it s eems to 
be obligatory only in conditional clauses where it occurs on the same verbal host 
with the limitative =lla. It does contribute meaning which alters the truth conditions 
of the utterance. It co-occurs with several other TK enclitics in fixed templates, being 
preceded by the limitative markers and followed by the markers of topic or focus. It 
optionally affects the lexical stress assignment of its hosts.  
3.3.2.14 =guti 
The marker =guti was, to my knowledge, not attested in other varieties of Quechua 
described to date. It is possible, however, that the marker is etmologically related to 
the verb kuti-y (return-INF), attested e.g.in Bolivian Quechua (Rosaleen Howard, p.c. 
23.09.2016).  
In the elicited discourse corpus of TK, it only occurred 13 times, but in the  larger, 
11h corpus of naturalistic discourse data, 108 further occurrences were encountered. 
When translating from Kichwa to Spanish, consultants most often claimed that =guti 
should be translated as Spanish discourse connective pues (‘well’), which has a  
discourse-cohesive function, and expresses meanings including causality and 
consequence. While such characterisation of the semantics of =guti seems to be at 
least partially accurate, evidence from translation is not enough to settle on how its 
meaning sh ould be defined (cf. Matthewson 2004) . It is also unclear at this stage 
whether, like pues, =guti could be analysed as always introducing new information 
(cf. Briz et al.  2008). It remains to be investigated what insights regarding the 
semantics and pragmatics of  =guti could be gained from comparing the TK enclitic  
to temporal update markers in Australian languages, with which =guti shares several 
distributional properties (cf. Ritz & Schultze-Berndt 2015).  
The distribution of =guti with different types of hosts is given in Table 3.15. The 
occurrences in the ‘elicited discourse’ corpus are shown in brackets: 
 
215

Table 3.15 shows that nearly two thirds of all tokens of =guti occured on verbs or 
predicates. Over 8 3% (n=69) of the  marker’s verbal hosts are finite. The enclitic  
mostly occured on verbs in declarative clauses , and it  was attested on verbs with 
present, past and future time reference. Consider:  
(3.130)

The enclitic also occured on verbal hosts with imperative (n=3) and prohibitive 
marking (n=1):  
(3.131)

lemon=lla-INS make-2SG.IMP=guti

In (3.132), =guti co-occurs on the same host with the negative/polar question marker 
=chu and the emphatic non -declarative =y, attaching outside both those markers. 
The enclitic was also found in interrogative clauses, occurring on verbs both with, 
(3.133) and without (3.134) interrogative morphology:  
(3.133)

ev_29082013_01c   018 
On nominal hosts, =guti occurred on heads of NPs fulfilling different grammatical 
roles, as well as on heads of personal and locative ProPs. An example of its 
occurrence o n a ProP with a subject function is (3.133) above, and the examples 
below are of =guti on subject (3.135) and object (3.136) NPs:

in_25052013_2_03   136 
It also co -occurred on nominal hosts with locative and dative case -marking. The 
enclitic =guti only occurs on adjectives when they are used predicatively, which 
suggests that like most of the other enclitics described in this chapter, it can only 
grammatically occur on phrasal heads. The enclitic only occurred on adverbs three 
times in the corpus, all of these on the same host, the time adverbial kuna (‘now’).  
The examples abo ve, together with their translations, suggest that =guti does not 
make a contribution to the truth conditions of the utterances. Closer examination of 
TK discourse suggests that =guti-marked utterances are more persuasive, or have 
stronger illocutionary po ints than  their unmarked equivalents, which seems to 
confirm that it could be analysed as a discourse connective, as suggested by the 
Spanish translation provided by the consultants. As shown with the examples above, 
it scopes over all types of speech acts , occurring in declarative, interrogative and 
imperative clauses. In this respect it differs from markers such as =mi and =ma, 
which also seem to have a non -truth conditional effect on the meaning of utterances, 
but are incompatible with imperatives. The e nclitic =guti does not have a fixed 
position in discourse sequences, occurring both in questions and answers in question-
answer pairs, and in discourse of different genres, including conversations and 
monologues. However, closer examination and more data a re needed to establish 
how exactly =guti fulfils its discourse -cohesive function, especially since it also 
occurs on particles, which are themselves discourse -cohesive devices (see Section 
3.1). It occurred on particles eleven times in the corpus, ten of those on discourse 
particles derived from shina (like.this), which, depending on the context, can be 
interpreted as indicating continuity of discourse, as in (3.137), or expressing 
understanding/agreement, as in (3.138):

in_13082014_01   156 
In (3.138), where =guti occurs on the particle indicating agreement with the previous 
statement, it co -occurs with the verum focus particle =tá (see Section 3.3.2.5), 
further enforcing the statement.  
The data show that =guti optionally triggers changes in lexical stress assignment, 
with stress patterns of about half of the tokens affected by the occurrence of the 
enclitic.  
To sum up, the enclitic =guti seems to express no truth -conditional meaning, but it 
does seem to strengthen the illocutionary force of the utterances it occurs in. The 
enclitic is compatible with all types of speech acts. The data suggest that it could be 
analysed as a discourse connectiv e, but the exact nature of its contribution to the 
clause needs further investigation. It was attested to co -occur on the same host with 
enclitic =cha, =chu, =y and =tá, attaching outside all of these enclitics. It is 
restricted to phrasal heads, and optionally affects the stress assignment of its host. 
3.3.2.15 =ri 
The enclitic =ri was not attested at all in the elicited discourse corpus. However, 42 
tokens of the marker were found in the naturalistic discourse corpus. For other 
Quechuan varieties, =ri has been identified as a question marker (cf. Itier 2011: 81) . 
Cusihuamán (1976/2001: 227) glosses the Cuzco Quechua (QI I) =ri as ‘responsive’ 
 
219 
 
and explains that  it marks topics in questions, indi cating continuity of conversation. 
For Tarma Quechua (QI), Adelaar (e.g. 2013: 106) also mentions an emphatic 
enclitic =ari, which can attach outside other enclitics, such as =mi or =cha, giving 
rise to their emphatic reading (see Sections 3.3.2.4 and 3.3.2.8). Calvo Pérez (1993: 
136) also analyses the Cuzco Quechua  =rí as an emphatic marker originating from 
the affirmative particle arí. While some  occurrences of the enclitic in TK are 
compatible with the ‘question topic’ interpretation, other indicate that the marker 
should rather be interpreted as a cognate of the emphatic =ari. Both these 
possibilities are discussed and illustrated with data below.  
Table 3.16 shows the distribution of the tokens of =ri with different types of hosts : 
Table 3.16 Distribution of =ri with different types of hosts

Percentage of

As shown in Table 3.16, over 55% of the tokens of =ri attach to verbal hosts, and 
over one third of the encountered tokens attached to adverbial hosts. However, all the 
occurrences of =ri on adverbs come from wedding songs. As discussed in Section 
3.3.2.1, it seems that the distribution of enclitics in TK wedding songs – and most 
likely, other types of songs as well – is driven by the need to preserve the rhythm, 
rather than by semantic or pragmatic considerations. In the wedding songs, all the 
tokens of =ri occurred on two hosts: kuna (‘now’) and washa (‘after’). Since no 
other occurrence s of =ri on adverbs were attested in the corpus, I will leave the 
analysis of the occurrences of =ri on adverbial hosts to future studies looking in 
more detail into the ritual song genre.  
There were only four occurrences of =ri on nouns and pronouns in the corpus:  
(3.139)

in_26052013_02   280 
Examples (3.139) and (3.140) above are the only two cases of =ri occurring on 
nouns. As much as it is difficult to generalise on the basis of so little data, the enclitic 
seems to carry some sort of an expressive meaning (Lyons 1995: 44), indicating the 
speaker’s emotional attitude with respect to the content of the proposition. 
Interpreting =ri as expressive would be in line with analysing it as a cognate of the 
emphatic =ari from other Quechuan varieties. Nonetheless, at this stage ‘expressive’ 
can only be used as a preliminary label, and more data is needed to provide a more 
satisfactory description of the semantics of =ri.  
The same can be said about its occurrence on a demonstrative pronoun in (3.141) and 
on an interrogative pronoun/particle (see Section 3.3.2.9) in (3.142):

In (3.141) =ri co-occurs on the same host wi th a diminutive marker, which is 
compatible with its ‘expressive’ interpretation – the DIM -wa is often used to convey 
information in an affective manner (see Section 2.3.1.2), and using =ri could further 
strengthen the affecti ve interpretation of the utterance. In (3.142), an opposite 
situation obtains. The speaker is scolding her daughters -in-law for not having 
brought the appropriate kitchen utensils. In this case, the use of =ri could be licenced 
by the speaker’s anger.  
The remaining tokens of =ri attested in the corpus all occur on verbs. On finite verbs, 
=ri was only attested to co -occur with first person (both singular and plural) and 
second person (singular):

Presence in interrogative constructions like (3.144) was the prototypical use of =ri 
described by Cusihuamán (1976/2001) for Cuzco  Quechua. As discussed at the 
beginning of this section, he claimed that the meaning of the enclitic was to mark 
discourse continuity and topics in questions. The data suggest that the poll of 
 
222 
 
speakers I worked with exhibits variation in their use of =ri. Using =ri in 
constructions such as (3.144) is seen as a dialectal feature by some of my consultants, 
and few of the speakers I have recorded use =ri as an interrogative topic marker. The 
‘interrogative topic marker’ interpretation is further put into question by the fact that 
most =ri-marked clauses attested in the corpus are not interrogative. Moreover, as 
shown, in (3.139), on non -verbal hosts =ri can attache to the same host as the topic 
marker =ga (see Section 3.3.2.1), which would result in redundancy if  both the 
enclitics were associated with of topicality. 
The enclitic co-occurs with the interrogative =ta and the emphatic =y:   
(3.145)  
Imay,  ima llakta nindayri? 
ima=y   ima  llakta  nin=ta=y=ri 
what=y what town say=ta=y=ri 
‘Which…which town did you say?’ 
in_13082014_01   377 
In (3.145), although occurring in an interrogative clause, =ri does not mark the topic 
of the question, b ut seems to add the ‘expressive’  meaning, compatible with the 
emphasis added to the utterance by =y. The two enclitics can also co-occur on verbal 
hosts in hypothetical constructions marked with the FUT -nga (see Section 2.4.2.2.4):  
(3.146)

‘Plantain should/would be good as well (when cooked).’ 
in_20092013_03   108 
 
223 
 
In (3.146), the ‘ expressive’ meaning of =ri, and well as of the non -declarative 
emphatic =y, could be licenced by the fact that the utterance is a part of a story, and 
the speaker wishes to convey the question as dramatic, since the disappearance of the 
daughter-in-law is crucial for the development of the story. The utterance in (3.147) 
presents the speaker ’s subjective evaluation of a certain proposition, and hence is 
also compatible with ‘expressive meaning’ as defined by Lyons (1995: 44).  
The enclitic =ri also occurs on imperative verbs, although such occurrences are not 
without analytical problems. In TK, the 2SG.IMP can be expressed either by the bare 
verb stem, or by the 2SG.IMP suffix -y (see Section 2.4.2.4.1 and (3.139) above).  
However, TK also has a coverb construction, wher e the coverb stem ri (‘to go’)  
attaches to the stem of the main verb, with or without a coverb marker -y-, yielding 
constructions with meaning similar to the English ‘go and do something’. Therefore, 
when occurring on imperative verbs, the enclitic =ri is often difficult to distinguish 
from the coverb construction. For the sake of consistency, all cases of the bare verb 
stem affixed with -y and -ri encountered in the corpus, which were semantically 
consistent with the ‘go and do x’ interpretation, were con sidered coverb 
constructions. Consider: 
(3.148)  
Ashangara  apayri...  kachun. 
Ashanga-ra apa    -y-ri  daughter-in-law 
basket-ACC biring-COV-go daughther-in-law 
‘Go bring the basket, daughter in law’ 
in_20092013_02   080 
The utterance in (3.148) was analysed as involving a coverb =ri, but in other cases, it 
could be assumed that =ri should be glossed as an enclitic, rather than a verb stem:  
(3.149)

‘If you want to, go get [married]!’ 
ev_29082013_01b   096 
Cusihuamán (1976/2001: 228) also observes that in Cuzco Quechua =ri only occurs 
on the verb if the clause has two elements, and the non-verbal element is marked by a 
focus enclitic. This is clearly not the case in TK, where most of the occur rences of 
=ri are on verbal hosts. He also claims that in clauses which only comprise one  
lexical word, =ri can co-occur with focus-marking enclitics such as =chu – this has 
not been attested in the TK corpus. As mentioned previously, in TK, =ri was attested 
to co-occur on the same host with the topic enclitic =ga, as in (3.139) above, but not 
with any of the focus enclitics.  
The non-co-occurrence of =ri with focus enclitics would be called into question if 
=mari and =chari (see Sections 3.3.2.4 and 3.3.2.8, respectively) were to be 
analysed as co -occurrences of the markers =cha and =ma with =ri. As mentioned 
previously, in other varieties of Quechua, =mari and =chari were analysed as 
emphatic versions of the markers =mi and =cha (cf. e.g. Cole 1982; Faller 2002) . 
For TK, this analysis is hard to uphold – or refute – on the basis of the little data 
available, and in the absence of negative evidence. Both =mari and =chari seem to 
carry an emphatic meaning component, although how this emphatic meaning arises 
is not clear at this stage. The distribution of both =mari and =chari differs from that 
of =ri alone. While =ri occurs mostly on verbal hosts, the other markers are more 
evenly distributed amongst hosts from many grammatical categories. What the 
markers do have in common, however, is that they were only attes ted to occur on 
phrasal heads. Another difference between the markers is that =ri always participates 
in the stress assignment of its hosts (see below), while =mari and =chari do so 
optionally. In sum, at this stage it is not possible to establish whether =mari and 
=chari should be analysed as co -occurrence of =mi (or =ma) and =cha with =ri. 
More token of =ri, =mari and =chari, and a clearer picture of the semantics of 
 
225 
 
‘emphatic’ and ‘expressive’ meaning in TK would be needed before any claims can 
be made in this respect.  
In terms of its position, =ri behaves like a clitic, attaching to the right of all 
inflectional morphology and the enclitics it co-occurs with – apart from =guti, which, 
as shown in (3.143), attaches outside =ri. However, morphophonologically it is more 
suffix-like. The preliminary auditory and pitch -contour examination of 29 tokens of 
the marker shows that in all the cases, =ri affected the lexical stress assignment of its 
host.  
In sum, the enclitic =ri is most often attested on verbal hosts . The corpus data show 
that it can co-occur with present and future tense  marking, and it is most often found 
in imperative, interrogative and hypothetical clauses, although it was also attested in 
assertions. It was only attested to occur on phrasal heads. Distribut ionally, =ri is 
clitic-like, but at the same time it participates in its hosts’ stress assignment. The 
enclitic can co-occur on the same host with the topic marker =ga, the interrogative 
=ta, the emphatic =y, and =guti. The meaning of the enclitic is diffi cult to gauge on 
the basis of the data in the corpus, especially since it is subject to inter -speaker 
variation. However, preliminary analysis suggests that  =ri carries an emphatic 
meaning.  
3.3.2.16 Morphosyntactic properties of clitics: a summary 
In the previous sections, I have discussed the basic morphosyntactic properties of the 
15 word-final markers attested in TK. A picture that emerges from that discussion is 
that of a set of semantically heterogeneous markers, which do, however, share many 
morphosyntactic p roperties. Notably, only one of the 15 enclitics, namely the 
limitative =lla (see Section 3.3.2.11) was attested to occur on both phrasal heads and 
dependents. All the remaining markers can only grammatically oc cur on clausal 
heads, which is in line with what has been said about word -final markers in other 
Quechuan varieties (cf. Muysken 1995; Sánchez 2010). 
Although I discuss this issue in detail in  Chapter 4, it is prudent to mention here that 
the clitics differ in scope depending on the type of host they attach to. The enclitics 
occurring on phrasal dependents only scope over their hosts; Enclitics occurring on 
phrasal heads scope over the entire relevant syntactic constituent.  
 
226 
 
In the section that follows, I provid e some generalisations regarding the 
morphophonological and morphosyntactic properties of the TK word -final markers 
discussed in the previous fifteen sections. I show similarities and differences between 
them, and discuss the possibility of classifying the m as clitics and/or discourse 
markers.  
 TK discourse enclitics: defining class membership  3.4
The objective of this section is to propose a taxonomy of TK enclitics, and to single 
out the paradigm of TK ‘discourse enclitics’, i.e. enclitics which, from the fu nctional 
point of view, can be classified as discourse markers. To this end, I discuss the data 
presented in Section 3.3 in the light of the definitiona l properties of enclitics (see 
Sections 3.2) and of discourse markers (see Section 3.1).  
Before a taxonomy of TK enclitics can be proposed, we need to establish which of 
the markers discussed in Section 3.3 can be analysed as e nclitics. Figure 3.5 (a 
repetition of Figure 3.3, see Section 3.2.2) contains the definitional properties of TK 
discourse enclitics:   
Figure 3.5 Properties of TK discourse enclitics 
A. Promiscuous attachment/ low host selectivity 
B. Phonological and prosodic dependency on the host 
C. Little morphophonological and semantic idiosyncrasy 
D. Being subject to few co-occurrence restrictions 
E. Position at the right edge of the word, in rigidly ordered clusters 
F. Expressing meanings related to discourse, rather than required by syntax 
In the sections that follow, I discuss the markers presented in Section 3.3 with 
respects to each of the six properties listed above. 
 A: Promiscuous attachment/ low host selectivity 3.4.1
The first criterion of clitic -hood from Figure 3.5 requires the least discussion, as I 
have discussed it already in the introduction to Section 3.3. I mentioned that the 
 
227 
 
markers discussed in this chapter were selected on the basis of low host selectivity, 
i.e. on the condition that they occurred on hosts from at least  two TK word classes. 
Therefore, it is not surprising that all the markers in the set fulfil this condition, albeit 
to varying extents. The possibilities of the markers to occur on different types of 
hosts, as attested in the corpus, are summarised in Table 3.17:

In Table 3.17, I show the co -occurrence of each of the enclitics with host s belonging 
to the different TK word classes. The boldface indicates the hosts with which a given 
marker co-occurred most often in the corpus. Note that the table includes a category 
of ‘attributive adjective’. Since no adjectival phrase exists in TK, this category was  
singled out to show the enclitics which can occur on phrasal dependents. As for 
nouns and pronouns, each of the markers listed as occurring with any of those classes 
can occur both on NP and ProP arguments, and on nouns and pronouns functioning 
predicatively.  
 
228 
 
Table 3.17 demonstratres that all the markers discussed in this chapter behave like 
clitics in terms of promiscuous attachment.  
 B: Phonological and prosodic dependency on the host 3.4.2
That all tentative members of the set are phonologically dependent  on a host follows 
from the fact that they meet criterion A: attach to phonologically independent hosts. 
However, the exact nature of their prosodic and phonological dependency on their 
hosts merits some discussion. As mentioned in Section 3.2.1, Spencer and Luís (2012: 
84) observe that  
[p]erhaps the most common property of clitics is that they (…) have no 
effect on the stress pattern of their hosts. 
Nonetheless, full prosodic integration with a host is not considered in the literature as 
a definitional criterion for clitic -hood (cf. Anderson 2005; Spencer & L uis 2012: 
chap. 4). Spencer and Luís (2012: 84-5) propose a distinction between clitics which 
are stress-neutral, those that ‘fall outside the stress system’ and those that ‘fall within 
the stress domain’. Following their suggestion, I divide the TK word -final markers 
into three categories, which I discuss in turn below:  
(1) markers that have inherent stress, 
(2) markers that never affect stress, and  
(3) markers that optionally affect stress. 
The classification which I present in the paragraphs below is based on the fact that in 
TK and other Qu echuan languages lexical stress normally falls on the penultimate 
syllable (see Section 2.1.2.2). Consequently, word-final markers were considered to 
affect stress if their occurrence on the host resulted in the change of this pattern.  
Out of all the markers considered in this chapter, only one, namely the verum focus 
marker =tá, carried inherent stress. As shown in Section 3.3.2.5, utterances of =tá 
were not considered felicitous if the marker was unstressed.  
The group of markers which never affect stress has several members. First, let us 
discuss those which phonologically behave like suffixes, i.e. they fall within the 
stress domain of their hosts. Just two such markers were attested in the corpu s, 
 
229 
 
namely the ‘expressive’ =ri and the ‘identity of reference’ =llara. I also include the 
limitative =lla into this category, despite the fact that in the data I examined, in 6 out 
of 77 cases where such evaluation was possible (see 3.3.2.11), it seemed not to affect 
stress assignment. While more research is needed, at this stage I hypothesise that 
these outlier examples were due to some other prosodic factors, not discussed here. 
The final marker which did not affect the stress  pattern of its host was the emphatic 
=y. The marker =y, unlike the ones mentioned previously, is non -syllabic, but where 
it occurs, it incorporates into the coda of the word -final syllable. The occurrence of 
=y, as far as the data show, never results in t he change of the penultimate lexical 
stress pattern. It should also be said that =s, the post -vocalic allomorph of the 
additive marker =pas, which also never affects stress assignment. 
The last  – and the largest – group of the word-final markers in TK are those that 
optionally affect the stress assignment of their hosts. The markers that belong to that 
group are : =ga, =mi, =ma, =mari, =chu, =cha, =chari, =ta, =guti and =pas 
(excluding its post-vocalic allomorph). Data from other Quechuan languages confirm 
that the word -final particle s are ‘usually, though not obligatorily stressed’. For 
Imbabura Quechua, a highland Quechuan variety also spoken in Ecuador , variable 
participation in stress assignment is reported for =ma, =mari, =cha and =chari, 
glossed as ‘validators’ (cf. Cole 1982: 209).  
The above analysis of the marker’s interaction with lexical stress relied, as 
mentioned previously, on auditory and pitch contour analyses. It is not currentl y 
possible to state which factors influence the varying behaviour of the markers with 
respect to the stress pattern on their hosts. This analysis also does not take into 
account prosodic processes on utterance level, such as the stress shift discussed 
briefly in Section 3.3.2.5 (see also Section  4.5.2), or possible effects of different 
types of suffixes on lexical stress assignment in TK (see Section  2.1.2.2). While 
detailed research into the prosody of TK falls outside the scope of this study, future 
studies on Tena Kichwa in general, and on the TK enclitics in particular, would 
benefit greatly from more fine-grained phonological and prosodic analysis.  
Since all the markers discussed in this chapter are bound morphemes, they are all 
phonologically dependent on their hosts. However, only the emphatic =y behaves 
like a ‘prototypical enclitic’ in the sense that it always falls outside of the stress -
 
230 
 
assignment domain of its hosts. Nonetheless, since non -participation in stress 
assignment is not a definitional criterion of clitic -hood, none of the markers should 
be excluded from the class on the basis of its morphophonological properties.  
 Little morphophonological and semantic idiosyncrasy 3.4.3
As mentioned previously, ‘morphophonological idiosyncrasies’ are irregular changes 
in the phonological form, which cannot be predicted from regular phonological 
processes affecting other words or groups of words. Zwicky and Pu llum (1983) 
predict that such irregularities are encountered more often in combination of stems 
and affixes than in those of clitic hosts and clitics, and this observation seems to 
apply to TK word-final markers. While several of them have a set of allomorphs, the 
sound changes which condition the occurrence of allomorphs are regular, rather than 
idiosyncratic, e.g. voiceless postalveolar affricate [t͡ ʃ] surfacing a s voiced 
postalveolar affricate [d͡ ʒ] after nasals.  
The lack of ‘semantic idiosyncrasies’ means that clitics should have a single meaning 
across contexts (cf. Spencer & Luis 2012: 109 -10). Most of the markers discussed in  
this chapter do have clearly defined meanings, e.g. t he marker =ga associated with 
topicality, NEG/Q =chu, additive =pas, verum focus -associated =tá, interrogative 
=ta, and the ‘identity of reference’ =llara. The meaning of the limitative =lla is, to 
some extent, idiosyncratic, ranging between unique reference, an adverbial meaning 
(‘exactly/precisely/just’) and a diminutive meaning, while none of them associated 
the occurrence of =lla in a particular grammatical context. However, it has also been 
mentioned that =lla behaves morphopohonologically more like a suffix than a clitic. 
The semantic idiosyncrasy it exhibits makes it even more suffix-like.  
The meanings of other markers  might seem prone to idiosyncrasies , based on the 
preliminary semantic description provided in this chapter. The aim of Chapter 4 and 
Chapter 5 of this thesis is to provide a detailed account of the meaning of a subset of 
the markers discussed he re. In these chapters, I show that information structural and 
epistemic meanings attributed to some of the markers can be accounted for in a 
uniform manner; To arrive at such uniform analysis, dimensions of meaning such as 
epistemicity and intersubjectivity are taken into account.  
 
231 
 
Consequently, it can be concluded that, apart from the mesoclitic =lla, none of the 
markers exhibits morphophonological or semantic idiosyncrasies.  
 Being subject to few co-occurrence restrictions 3.4.4
This criterion demands that the ‘gaps in the set of possible combinations’ (Zwicky & 
Pullum 1983) be more common with affixes than with clitics. I discuss the possible 
combinations of clitics with one another in Section 3.4.5. Here, I focus on the co -
occurrence restrictions with inflectional morphology and syntactic structures.  
The co-occurrence restrictions of enclitics were discussed in previous literature for 
other Quechuan varieties, e.g. Imbabura Quechua, spoken in the Ecuadorian 
Highlands (QII, Cole 1982: 163–72). Cole divided the Imbabura enclitics into several 
subgroups. He observed that most co -occurrence restrictions apply to ‘validators’, 
(=mi, =ma, =mari, =cha and =chari) which, in Imbabura (1) can be used with any 
part of speech, (2) appear to the right of derivational and inflectional suffixes, but (3) 
are limited to constituents of main clauses, and (4) can only occur once per sentence. 
Other enclitics he lists, including the topic marker =ka and the additive clitic =pash, 
only abide by the first two criteria. He also mentions that ‘validator’ enclitics do not 
occur with NPs modifiers, including attributive adjectives.  
Some, but not all, of the properties listed by Cole (1982) apply to the TK enclitics. 
As evident from the discussion in the previous section, and from the Table 3.18, most 
of the TK enclitics can occur on any part of speech. When the restrictions exist, they 
apply to the occurrence of the markers on phrasal heads and dependent. As shown in 
the descriptions of the markers in Section 3.3, most of the TK enclitics are restricted 
to occur on phrasal heads. One exception in this regard is =lla, which was th e only 
marker in the data that could occur on attributive adjectives.    
As for the other criteria proposed by Cole, none of the TK enclitics is restricted to 
main clauses – all markers co-occurred with finite verbs and were, at least in several 
instances, attested with non -finite verbs occurring in subordinate clauses. Lastly, 
most, but not all TK enclitics are restricted to occurring just once in a sentence. As 
far as the data show, this restriction does not apply to =ga and =chari. Issues related 
multiple occurrences of clitics per clause are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.  
 
232 
 
In sum, all the markers discussed in this section show few, if any, co -occurrence 
restrictions in terms of occurrence on different parts of speech,  or with nominal and 
verbal derivational and inflectional morphology. In the next section, I discuss the co -
occurrence restrictions of TK clitics with one another.  
 Position at the right edge of the word, in rigidly ordered clusters 3.4.5
According to this crite rion, in order to be classified as an enclitic, a marker needs to 
occur on the right edge of its host. This is true for all the markers described in this 
chapter, with the exception of the mesoclitic =lla (3.3.2.11), and, to some extent the 
marker =llara (3.3.2.12). The classification of =llara as an enclitic is problematic, 
since it was also attested to attach to the left of the accusative case suffix.  All the 
other m arkers attach, without exceptions, outside all inflectional and derivational 
morphology.  
All the markers, however, occur  in rigidly ordered clusters. Table 3.18 shows how 
they are ordered with respect to one anoth er, also taking their co -occurrence 
restrictions into account.  
Table 3.18 Ordering of TK enclitics

233 
 
Table 3.18 contains a schematic representation of the co -occurrences of TK enclitics 
attested in the corpus. The columns from left to right repr esent the markers attaching 
closer (left) and further (right) from the boundary of the hos t word. Unless otherwise 
stated – as in the case of =llara, which was not attested to co-occur with =ri – all the 
markers in the same row can co -occur with one anothe r, although they were not all 
necessarily attested to have all co-occurred on the same host at the same time.  
It has to be kept in mind that not all the co -occurrence possibilities were tested in 
elicitation and it is therefore possible that the co -occurrence of some markers which 
did not occur on the same host in the corpus is grammatically possible. 
It is evident from Table 3.18 that the markers in the middle column form a clear 
distributional paradigm. For all o f these markers, it was checked in elicitation that 
they cannot grammatically co-occur on the same host. It is also this group of markers 
that the remainder of this thesis is concerned with. They not only form a 
morphosyntactic paradigm, but also share cer tain aspects of their meaning, related to 
information structure and distribution of knowledge between participants of 
discourse (see Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, respectively). 
 Expressing discourse-related meanings 3.4.6
This final criterion does not have to do with establishing whether the marker in 
question is a clitic from the morphosyntactic point of view. Rather, it allows 
distinguishing clitics that can be described as dis course markers from those that 
cannot. I discussed the notion of discourse markers in Section 0, where I also 
introduced the distinction between discourse markers and discourse connectives. For 
the purposes of this thesis, disc ourse markers were defined as non -truth conditional 
elements which increase cohesion and coherence of discourse (see Section  1.3.2). 
Discourse connectives achieve that effect by linking discourse segments to one  
another, but cohesion of discourse can also be increased by other means. In Section 0, 
I mentioned ‘interpersonal discourse markers’, which facilitate interpretation of 
discourse via indexing and negotiating roles of discourse  participants. I consider 
most of the TK enclitics to belong to this class of discourse markers.  
 
234 
 
Let us consider Table 3.18 again. As mentioned above, it is divided into three 
columns. The markers in the middle co lumn never co -occur with one another, and 
therefore constitute a distributionally coherent paradigm. Moreover, these nine 
markers all have meanings which, rather than being truth -conditional, are related to 
information management in discourse. It was menti oned before that their meaning is 
related to Information Structure. I discuss their IS functions in more detail in  Chapter 
4. In Chapter 5, I show that some of these markers also have an epistemic m eaning. 
Therefore, I postulate that the markers =mi, =ma, =mari, =cha, =chu, =chari, =tá 
and =ta should be considered ‘epistemic/interpersonal’ discourse enclitics which 
form a notionally and distributionally coherent paradigm. They occupy the same 
position within clitic clusters, are restricted to occurrence on clausal heads, and 
optionally affect the stress assignment of their hosts.  
Two additional markers described in this chapter, namely =pas and =guti, could also 
be classified as discourse cohesive de vices. However, according to the definitions 
introduced in Section 3.1, the additive =pas is a ‘discourse connective’, rather than a 
‘discourse marker’. Moreover, although it can link discourse segments above the 
clausal level, it is also often used to connect constituents within the same clause ( see 
Section 2.5.3.1). Therefore, its function is ambiguous between a ‘textual’ and 
‘discourse’ connective (cf. e.g. Traugott 2010; Degand 2016).  
As for =guti, it was also tentatively analysed as a discourse connective, although no t 
enough data is available at present to establish the precise nature of its meaning. 
While future research is needed to provide a detailed account of =guti, it can be 
excluded from the paradigm discussed in this thesis on distributional grounds.  
The final two enclitics are =ri and =y, which I have analysed as ‘expressive’ and 
‘non-declarative interrogative’. While these two markers make a non -truth 
conditional contribution to the meaning of the utterance, they operate locally – 
indicating the emotional involvement or assessment of the proposition by the speaker 
– rather than on a discourse level.   
In the literature, ‘prototypical’ discourse markers have been argued to occur 
sentence-initially (e.g. Schiffrin 1987) , the TK discourse enclitics could be 
considered ‘non-prototypical’ discourse markers, i.e. markers which do not ‘fulfil the 
 
235 
 
structural requirement of being sentence initial’ (Maschler & Schiffrin 2015:  200). 
Morphosyntactically, the TK discourse enclitics might not fit the definition of a 
prototypical discourse marke r. Nonetheless, as I show in  Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, 
their semantics, and function in discourse are very much in line with a range of 
discourse-cohesive meanings which are, cross-linguistically, the domain of discourse 
markers.  
 Summary: TK class of discourse enclitics 3.4.7
In the previous sections, I have discussed the properties of TK word -final markers, 
and checked how they align with the definitional properties of clitics. A summary of 
this discussion is presented in Table 3.19:

The columns of the table represent the six properties of enclitics discussed in the 
previous sections. Each row corresponds to one of the markers. The relevant field is 
marked with ‘X’ only if the marker can be characterised by a given prop erty in all its 
occurrences. Note that the final property: ‘expressing discourse -related meanings’ is 
semantic, rather than morphosyntactic, and can be used to delimit a particular sub -
class of enclitics. The enclitics which I analyse as encoding discourse -related 
meanings, and forming a coherent paradigm, are shown in bold in the table.  
Table 3.19 clearly shows that the markers discussed in this chapter form a scale, 
from those with most clitic -like properties – like =y (‘non-declarative emphatic’), 
which meets all the morphosynta ctic criteria – to those which show more suffix-like 
properties, like the limitative mesoclitic =lla. This shows that  in TK, there is no 
binary distinction between clitics and suffixes – rather, the different markers 
discussed above could be placed along a continuum. On the basis of the above, it 
seems that the only marker which could not be classified as an enclitic is the 
limitative mesoclitic =lla. The ‘identity of reference’ marker =llara, diachronically 
most likely related to =lla, is ambiguous between an enclitic and a mesoclitic. All the 
other markers can be classified as enclitics, although most of them, unlike 
‘prototypical’ clitics, do not fall outside the domain of stress assignme nt of their 
hosts.  
Table 3.19 also shows that the markers which I analyse as ‘discourse enclitics ’, 
(shown in bold ) are uniform with respect to the clitic -like properties they exhibit. 
This strengthens the previou sly presented idea that they form a coherent 
morphosyntactic paradigm. The chapters that follow focus on this paradigm of 
epistemic/interpersonal discourse enclitics.

 Discourse markers and information  Chapter 4
   structure in Tena Kichwa 
In Chapter 3, I have described the morphosyntactic properties of TK enclitics, and 
singled out the paradigm of ‘discourse enclitics’. This chapter explores the role of 
discourse enclitics in marking information structural categories in TK. Firstly, I  
define the relevant notions, and outline the methodology used in this study ( 4.1). 
Subsequently, I discuss the previous studies of Quechuan information structure ( 4.2) 
and the syntactic means of marking information structural categories in TK ( 4.3). 
Subsequently, I proceed to the core part of this chapter, discussing the role of TK 
interaction of discourse enclitics with information structural categories of topic (4.4), 
and focus (4.5). Finally, I provide a brief summary of the chapter (4.6). 
 Definitions and methodology 4.1
In this section, I define the basic notions pertinent to the cross -linguistic study of 
information structure ( 4.1.1), and the methodology I used to investigate how the IS 
notions are syntactically and morphologically marked in the TK (4.1.2). 
4.1.1 Definitions 
In this section, I first define the notion of Information Structure as it is used in this 
thesis and briefly discuss the theoretical basis  for this chosen definition. 
Subsequently, I discuss the categories relevant to the description of the information 
structure of TK.  
Information structure (henceforth IS) is a component of sentence organisation , 
dedicated to the pragmatic structuring of pr opositions. Cross-linguistically, IS can be 
marked via syntax, morphology or prosody. Irrespective of how it is marked, the 
objective of IS is to facilitate information exchange, in order to satisfy the immediate 
communicative needs of interlocutors (cf. e.g. Chafe 1976; Prince 1981; Lambrecht 
1994; Féry & Krifka 2008; Dalrymple & Nikolaeva 2011) . The different theories of 
grammar vary in terms of the role they assign to IS , and in how they see its place 
within the structure of the language (see e.g. Erteschik-Shir 2007 for an overview ). 
 
238 
 
In this thesis, I understand IS as an element of sentence grammar which delivers 
pragmatically marked propositions, resulting from the speaker’s assumptions about 
the knowledge state of the addressee (Lambrecht 1994). This approach to IS is in line 
with understanding it as a phenomenon of ‘information packaging’ which responds 
to immediate communicative needs of interlocutors (cf. Chafe 1976).  
Communicative needs cannot be defined or attended to, however, unless discourse 
participants know what information they already share. Therefore, at the core of IS as 
understood in this thesis is the concep t of common ground (cf. Krifka 2007; Féry & 
Krifka 2008) . Common ground (henceforth CG) consists of information which is 
mutually known to be shared by the discour se participants (cf. Stalnaker 1974). This 
information includes discourse referents interlocutors are familiar with, and ‘a set of 
propositions which the participants in the conversation mutually agree to treat as true 
for the purpose o f the exchange’  (Stalnaker & Cole 1978) . CG constantly develops 
over the course of communication, and Krifka (2007) points out that two aspects of 
CG are relevant to communication: CG content, which includes all the truth -
conditional inf ormation within the CG, and CG management, which indicates the 
way in which CG content should develop. Both CG content and CG management are 
shared between discourse participants. The aspects of IS that have truth -conditional 
impact can be associated with CG content, and those relating to the ‘pragmatic use of 
expressions’ – with CG management (Krifka 2007:  18). Over the course of this 
chapter, I show that TK discourse enclitics contribute to CG management, rather than 
to CG content.  
As me ntioned above, in order to communicate effectively, speakers need to make 
assumptions about the mental states of their addressees. There are two types of such 
IS-relevant assumptions : (1) assumptions about the representation of discourse 
referents in the m ind of the addressee, and (2) assumptions about the addressee’s 
state of knowledge (cf. Prince 1981; Lambrecht 1994).  
The representation of discourse referents in the mind of the addressee can be 
described in terms of at least two cognitive statuses  (cf. Chafe 1976) : (i) 
identifiability and (ii) activation (cf. e.g. Lambrecht 1994: ch. 3) . Identifiability 
relates to the speaker’s assumptions about whether a representation of a referent is 
stored in the hearer’s mind (cf. Lambrecht 1994: 76) . Identifiable referents are those 
 
239 
 
of which both the speaker and addressee have a mental representation at the time of 
utterance. N on-identifiable referents  are those for which the representation only 
exists in the mind of the speaker and has to be  created in the mind of the addressee 
by means of the speaker’s utterance.  
The other cognitive status, a ctivation, distinguishes between those identifia ble 
referents which, according to the speaker, are in the addressee’s current focus of 
consciousness, and those that are not (cf. Prince 1981; Chafe 1987; 1994; Lambrecht 
1994). If a referent is in the addressee’s focus of consciousness, it is active . 
Otherwise, it is ‘inactive’ (Lambrecht 1994)  or ‘unused’ (Prince 1981) . In an 
intermediate situation, the referent is ‘semi-active’/‘accessible’ (cf. Lambrecht 1994: 
93-4). Referents can become accessible in a number of ways. A ‘textually accessible’ 
referent is one that has been mentioned in previous discourse and has subsequ ently 
lost its central status . ‘ Situationally accessible’  referents are present in the text -
external world (Lambrecht 1994: 100). Lastly, ‘inferential accessibility’ is related to  
cognitive schem a, or ‘frame s’: stereotypes, or systems of related concepts which 
facilitate inference processes  by allowing to assume the existence of certain entities 
(Prince 1981; Fillmore 1982; Chafe 1994) . For instance, a cognitive frame of ‘going 
to a restaurant’ activates concepts such as ‘waiter’ or ‘bill’, and makes other concepts, 
such as ‘mango lassi’  or ‘Caesar salad’  accessible. Figure 4.1 summarises the 
distinctions pertinent to identifiability and activation discussed above.

The second type of IS-relevant speaker assumptions are those concerning the 
hearer’s state of knowledge. Discussing them requires introducing the notions of 
pragmatic presupposition and pragmatic assertion. Pragmatic presupposition is a set 
of propositions that the speaker assumes the addressee already knows at the time of 
utterance (cf. Kempson 1975). By contrast, pragmatic assertion can be equated with 
‘new’ content, such that the speaker assumes the addressee will come to know it as a 
result of the speaker’s curre nt utterance (cf. Lambrecht 1994: 52) .35 In both cases, 
‘knowing’ a proposition is tantamount to having a mental representation of it, rather 
than being able to judge it true of false.  
Discussing only presupposed concepts does not make for effective communication, 
since ‘a narrative that fails to conflict with expectations is no narrative at all’ (Chafe 
1994: 122). However, there are cognitive constraints on how much new information 
can be conveyed at a time. According to the ‘one new idea constraint’ (Chafe 1987; 
1994), for processing reasons, every clause in connected discourse can contain only 
one concept which falls under the scope of assertion : the focus of the clause. Clauses 
also contain  presupposed content, and within i t, an expression denoting a referent 
which the clause is ‘about’ (cf. Lambrecht 1994: 127). In IS terms, this referent is the 
topic of the clause. Both topic and focus are relational notions . That is, no referent is 
inherently focal or topical. Rather, the topic or focus relation arises between 
discourse referents or concepts on the one hand,  and propositions on the other  as a 
result of the speaker’s strategy of CG management . Topic referents exist in the text-
external world , irrespective of whether the linguistic expressions  which designate 
them are specially marked, or even  present in discourse (cf. e.g. Krifka 2007) .36 
Therefore, it is important to distinguish between topic  (and focus) expressions in 
discourse and their designata in the text-external world. In what follows, by using the 
terms ‘topic’ and ‘focus’ , I  refer not to the linguistic expressions of the two 
categories, but to the objects or concepts they designate.  
As mentioned above, t opic can be broadly defined as the referent the proposition is 
about (cf. e.g. Reinhardt 1982; Lambrecht 1994: 188 and references therein; Krifka 
2008). The aboutness relation holds between the re ferent and the proposition when 
                                                 
35 Notice that in this usage the term ‘assertion’ is synonymous with ‘statement’, rather than meant to 
refer to the assertive speech act (cf. Lambrecht 1994: 55).  
36 In case of the designata of focal expressions, the case is more complex, since focus expressions can 
designate not only entities, but also concepts and propositions. 
 
241 
 
‘the referent is assumed by the speaker to be a centre of current interest, about which 
the assertion is made’ (Nikolaeva 2001: 4-5; cf. Kiss 1998: 9). It follows that topic is 
part of the pragmatic presupposition, sufficiently salient to be  considered the centre  
of attention b y both interlocutors. An important property of topic expressions is that 
they are referential, so that propositions about them can be evaluated as true or false  
(e.g. Lambrecht 1994).  
‘Aboutness’ topics can be divided into different sub -categories, e.g. (1) aboutness -
shift topics, which introduce a new discourse topic, replacing the previous ones  (2) 
contrastive topics and (3) familiar topics (Frascarelli 2007:693). Sánchez (2010) used 
these categories to describe topic marking in Cuzco Quechua . They are also relevant 
to the description of TK. In Section 4.4 I show that in TK topics of type (1) and (2) 
are much more likely to be marked morphologically than familiar topics.  
Contrastive topic expressions occur when an issue under discussion is too complex to 
be resolved by bringing up one single topic (Krifka 1999; Féry & Krifka 2008: 129). 
They are topical, because they refer to an entity about which further information is 
required, and contrastive, because they come with alternatives – information is 
needed about more than one topical referent (cf. Krifka 1999: 114). The function of a 
contrastive topic is to indicate that the answer is partial (Krifka 1999: 121).37  
Another type of topic expressions are ‘fra mes’ or ‘clause external topics’ (cf. Chafe 
1976; Li & Thompson 1976) : expressions setting a ‘spatial, temporal or i ndividual 
framework within which the main predication holds’ . Cross -linguistically, these 
expressions often correspond to adverbials (Nikolaeva 2001:  11). In TK, the most 
common frame-setting expressions are locative pronouns, but adverbials – especially 
time adverbials – also function as frame-setters (see Section 4.4).  
The second major category of IS is focus. Unlike topic, focus does not fall under the 
scope of pragmatic presupposition . It  is not pragmatically recoverable from prior 
discourse (Lambrecht 1994: 207) . Focus is what makes the utterance increase the 
knowledge of the addressee, by conveying content which is ‘informative, or contrary 
to e xpectation’ (Engdahl & Vallduví 1996) . Nonetheless, the function of focus 
                                                 
37 In referring to topics as ‘contrastive’ I assume that contrast is an IS category separate from, a nd 
orthogonal to, topic and focus. The nature of contrast has been a contentious issue in the scholarship 
on IS, and I discuss it in more detail towards the end of this section. 
 
242 
 
cannot be reduced to introducing new discourse referents. Unlike topic expressions, 
focus expressions need not be referential. Depending on the part of the utterance 
falling under the scope of focus,  different focus structures can be distinguished: 
argument focus, predicate focus and sentence focus. In case of argument focus, the 
scope of focus is narrow: it only corresponds to the constituent denoting the focal 
referent, while the rest of the utteran ce is pragmatically presupposed. In predicate 
focus constructions, the entire predicate  (which most often, but not necessarily, 
corresponds to the VP)  is in the scope of focus, and the subject of the clause is 
topical. Sentence focus structures, also calle d ‘thetic sentences’ or ‘out -of-the-blue’ 
sentences, are topicless – the entire sentence is under the scope of focus (Lambrecht 
1994: ch. 4). These three types of structures are discussed in turn below.  
Predicate and argument foci allow for different roles of activated referents within the 
focus domain. When expressions denoting active referents occur in a predicate focus 
structure, they are never the only element there, as that would render the utterance 
uninformative. Apart from a given element, the focus domain must also contain the 
predicate, and, optionally, a brand new/inactive NP (cf. Nikolaeva 2001: 9):  
  (4.1)
a. She   talked to him 
TOPIC  PREDICATE FOCUS (predicate + given PP) 
b. She   met an ugly old man 
TOPIC  PREDICATE FOCUS (predicate + brand new NP) 
Nikolaeva 2001: 9 
In argument focus structure, the denotatum of the focused constituent can be either 
active or inactive.  However, focus on an active referent is likely to receive a 
contrastive interpretation (cf. e.g. Kiss 1998). Consider the following examples:   
  (4.2)
A:  Where did you go last night? 
B:   We went to the restaurant.  
 
 
243 
 
  (4.3)
A:   Where did you go last night, to the movies or to the restaurant? 
B:   We went to the restaurant [not to the movies].  
              based on Lambrecht (1994: 211) 
In (4.2), the constituent ‘to the restaurant’ is an information focus – it is new in 
discourse and contributes the information requested in th e interlocutor’s question. In 
B’s utterance in (4.3), the same constituent functions as contrastive focus expression. 
It is active, having been was introduced into discourse by A, and it stands in 
opposition to an overt alternative ‘to the movies’. These two properties: having a set 
of identifiable alternatives (cf. Kiss 1998; Repp 2010)  and implying the rejection of 
those alternatives (Repp 2010: 1336) are the key properties of contrastive foci.  
The third type of focus structure mentioned above is sentence focus  (cf. e.g. 
Lambrecht 1994: ch. 5): 
  (4.4)
A:  What happened?  
B:  Grandpa died. 
As mentioned above, i n sentence focus structures, the pragmatic presupposition is 
non-existent. This is shown in the utterance B in  (4.4), where the whole sentence 
corresponds to pragmatic assertion and is within the scope of focus.  This type of 
focus structure often occurs discourse-initially, when no information is presupposed.  
Another type of focus structure relevant to the description of IS in TK is ‘verum 
focus’, i.e. focus on the truth value of the proposition  (cf. Höhle 1992). The nature 
the verum operator was defined in different ways in the literature , but the discussion 
of those different analyses is beyond the scope of this study  (see Lohnstein 2016 for 
overview). Here, I focus on the properties of verum foci relevant to the description of 
the TK verum focus marker =tá (see Section 4.5.2). Verum-focused clauses are the 
opposite of all -new clauses, sin ce the only new part of the clause is the focus on its 
assertive component (Büring 2006, cited in Lohnstein 2016: 297):  
 
 
244 
 
  (4.5)
A:  Did you go to the movies last night? 
B:  We did go. 
It follows that verum-focused clauses are not felicitous in discourse-initial utterances 
(Gutzmann & Castroviejo Miró 2011:  160; Lohnstein 2016:  303-4). However, 
Gutzmann and Castroviejo Miró (2011: 160) also show that the propositional content 
of a verum focus  clause must have been textually, rather than situationally evoked. 
From that, they conclude that the semantics of verum focus is to  resolve a question 
under discussion (QUD) corresponding to the verum -focused proposition. In Section 
4.5.2, I show that this definition can be applied to verum focus constructions in TK.  
Not all content of pragmatically structured propositions can be subsumed under the 
notions of topic or focus. Two more categories, ‘background’ and ‘completive’, have 
been suggested in the literature (Butt & Holloway King 2000; Dalrymple & 
Nikolaeva 2011). ‘Background’ consists of presupposed content, specifying details 
necessary for a complete understanding of focused information (Butt & Holloway 
King 2000). ‘Completive’, on the other hand, covers content n ew to the addressee, 
but, unlike focus, not associated with the difference between the pragmatic assertion 
and pragmatic presupposition (Butt & Holloway King 2000) . Consider the following 
example given by Butt and Holloway King (2000): 
  (4.6)
A:  What is Bill eating? 
B:  He   is eating                     pizza             in the kitchen. 
      TOPIC   BACKGROUND      FOCUS         COMPLETIVE 
The VP ‘is eating pizza’ consists of the focal NP ‘pizza’, and the  verb, which is not 
topical, but  provides the background necessary for complete understanding o f the 
proposition. The completive PP ‘in the kitchen’ is not presupposed, but also does not 
directly contribute to enhancing the addressee’s knowledge of the topic referent.  
Another IS notion which is an object of considerable attention – and controversy – is 
contrast (cf. e.g. Molnár 2 006; Zimmermann 2008; Repp 2010 ) or ‘kontrast’ (e.g. 
Vallduví & Vilkuna 1998) . In the IS literature, ‘contrast’ has acquired several 
 
245 
 
divergent meanings. Some authors use this notion to refer to a subtype of focus (cf. 
e.g. Gundel 1999; Cohan 2001) . Others use the same term in a different sense, as a 
category orthogonal to the t opic-focus articulation (Lambrecht 1994; Vallduví & 
Vilkuna 1998; Nikolaeva 2001: 8 and references therein) . The latter view is better 
suited for the descript ion of the information structure of TK, where both contrastive 
foci and contrastive topics are attested. In what follows, contrast is treated as a 
separate notion of information structure, and the feature of contrastiveness - as a 
‘discourse-semantic pheno menon with grammatical reflexes’ (Zimmermann 2008: 
348), which can be superimposed on the topic -focus articulation (cf. e.g. Lambrecht 
1994: 286-295; Krifka 2007) . A unified definition of contrast encompasses two 
aspects of its meaning. Firstly, contrast always operates on alternatives, whereas the 
character of the set of alternatives (open vs closed) and the presence of alternatives in 
the linguistic and situational context are of secondary importance. Secondly, contrast 
is always connected to highlighting (Molnár 2006:  212-3). This broad definition 
allows for reconciling the notion of contrast with contrastive foci, contrastive topics, 
parallel structures, or corrections, despite the fact that these phenomena differ e.g. in 
terms of rejection of alternatives and exhaustive identification (Repp 2010: 1335). In 
Sections 4.4 and 4.5, I show that in TK, the presence of contrast triggers 
morphological marking of both topic and focus.  
Before I proceed to the discussion of methods used in this study, a short discussion 
of the scope of the TK discourse enclitics is in order. In Chapter 3, I have identified 
the types of hosts with which each marker can co -occur, and I have shown that the 
enclitics only occur on phrasal heads. Consequently, the enclitics take scope over the 
whole phrase of the head to which they attach. Thus, on NPs and  AdvPs, which 
function as core or oblique arguments of the clause, the enclitics trigger narrow 
focus/topic interpretations – that is, they only scope over the phrase on the head of 
which they occur. When occurring on  non-verbal predicates, as well as on  tensed 
verbs, they trigger wide scope, which mostly corresponds to the predicate (cf. 
Sánchez 2010: 62-4), but in some contexts can also be sentential. When occurring on 
subordinate verbs, the enclitics’ scope is over the whole subordinate clause headed 
by that verb.

4.1.2 Methodology of studying TK information structure 
In this section,  I discuss the methodological issues  related to studying IS in under -
described languages like TK. Firstly, I focus on the methods, tools and stimuli I used 
for the purpose of t he present study (4.1.2.1). Secondly, I discuss the challenges 
encountered in this fieldwork -based study of IS, especially those related to using 
tools and stimuli which were not designed specifically for a given field -setting 
(4.1.2.2).  
4.1.2.1 Tools adopted in the current study 
In her seminal text on the methodology of semantic fieldwork, Matthewson (2004) 
states that while naturalistic discourse is an extremely valuable source of linguistic 
data, in semantic fieldwork it needs to be coupled with different types of structured 
elicitation. The same could be said with regard to fieldwork on IS. As discussed in 
Section 1.3.4.2, the main problems with basing one’s analytical claims exclusi vely 
on naturalistic discourse are (1) the impossibility of obtain ing negative evidence and 
(2) the fact that naturalistic text s are unlikely to contain data about all the releva nt 
phenomena, especially in the study of semantics, pragmatics or information structure 
(cf. Matthewson 2004: 377).  
In studying ‘context sensitive phenomena, such as presupposition’ (Matthewson 
2004: 395), establishing the communicative context appropriate for a given utterance 
is ex tremely important. Information S tructure also is a ‘context sensitive 
phenomenon’, best studied on the basis of coherent and cohesive texts (see Section  
1.3.2) larger than a sentence. While naturalistic d iscourse is an obvious source of 
such texts, using it as the sole source of data is even more problematic in case of IS 
research that in case of semantic fieldwork. While relational notions such as topic or 
focus may be constrained or influenced by the dis course context, they are not 
uniquely determined by it. The speaker’s intentions with regard to topic -focus 
articulations of their utterance are not necessarily determined only by context 
(Gundel & Fretheim 2004:  177). They can also be influenced by e.g. the speaker’s 
interests, perspective on the information conveyed, or previous experience.  In this 
respect, the relational notions of focus and topic are more subjective than notions of 
activation or identifiability, which are uniquely determined by the context. Therefore, 
whether or not to present information as focal/topical is ultimately a decision made 
 
247 
 
by the speaker, depending on the subjective perspective they choose to adopt. 
Consequently, studying the linguistic context of an utterance without an ins ight into 
the speaker’s motivations and mental states will only deliver partial results regarding 
the possible topic-focus articulations. 
 
Given this possible indeterminacy of IS categories, it is particularly important to be 
able to elicit texts where  the content and development of CG, as well as the 
intentions of the interlocutors, can be monitored by the researcher. The same holds 
for researching other categories related to ‘social cognition’ (San Roque et al. 2012) , 
e.g. evidentiality or epistemic meaning (see Section  5.1). Picture- or video -based 
stimuli designed for other purposes, e.g. the Pear Story (Chafe 1980)  used in this 
thesis, the ‘Frog Story’ (Mayer & Mayer 1992)  used e.g. by Sánchez (2015), 
illustrations for traditional tales (cf. Muntendam 2015) , or games (cf. Silva & 
AnderBois 2016)  can be used to ensure the possibility of knowledge -tracking. 
Stimuli can also be developed specifically for that purpose. Skopeteas et al. (2006) 
have developed a set of stimuli designed specifically for research on IS, which I have 
adapted and used in my fieldwork.  
The Questionnaire on Information Structu re (QUIS, Skopeteas et al. 2006)  is a 
complete manual comprising translation tasks and picture - and video-based stimuli, 
meant to elicit comprehensive data related to the expressions of information structure. 
In my case, a n important motivati on for choosing  to use QUIS was that it elicits a 
range of different speech types, and that the decision as to what will be said is  
ultimately left mostly to the speaker (cf. San Roque et al. 2012: 137). It also contains 
what L üpke (2009) calls ‘interactive stimuli’, i.e. stimuli which elicit dialogue, 
including map tasks, problem -solving tasks, or tasks consisting in ordering pictures 
into a narrative sequence (cf. San Roque et al. 2012).  
The ‘interactive stimuli’ are of particular importance for the description and analysis 
of discourse enclitics, the use of which i s sensitive to a range of contextual factors. 
Moreover, as already mentioned in  Chapter 3 , the TK discourse enclitics are 
grammatically obligatory in few, if any contexts. Consequently, in studying them, 
translation-based elicitation needs to be complemented with more interactive 
elicitation tasks. The fact that certain markers or constructions occur in connected 
 
248 
 
discourse warrants their felicity in the context in which they are used (cf. 
Matthewson 2004). The reverse, however, is not true: the fact that discourse markers 
do not occur in certain texts does not entail it would not be  felicitous for them to 
occur. Therefore, a range of elicitation tasks is needed to thoroughly investigate the 
discourse markers.  
The QUIS set consists of elicitation tasks and 29 experimental tasks  focusing on the 
different aspects of IS. A manual is provided to describe the goals of each task, and 
details of how the stimuli should be administrated. The authors of the Questionnaire 
have divided the tasks into four sessions for a single informant, and four sessions for 
two informants. The tasks are randomised and repeated in different orders throughout 
the sessions (cf. Skopeteas et al. 2006) . Out of the 29 tasks in the manual, I have 
selected 18, on the basis of two factors. Firstly, I have chosen the tasks aimed at 
investigating the distinction between given and new information, focus, con trast, and 
topicality. Secondly, I decided not to use the tasks which required familiarity with 
complex interpretative conventions (see Section 4.1.2.2 for discussion).  
The pictures for most of the tasks I chose were adapted t o my fieldwork context in 
collaboration with an illustrator, Irene Rus. The pictures were re -drawn to better 
depict the reality of the speakers of Tena Kichwa: characters, objects and activities 
presented in the pictures were changed to fit the Amazonian r eality (for examples, 
see Image 4.1, Image 4.2 and Image 4.3 in Section 4.4). The QUI S elicitation 
allowed me to gain insight into syntactic marking of IS ( 4.3), as well as the 
distribution of the enclitic =ga (4.4). However, it only contained few instances of the 
focus-marking encl itics ( 4.5), so their description is based mostly on other 
translation/elicitation tasks contained in the corpus, and on naturalistic discourse. 
The QUIS tasks were carried out with two consultants, a male and a female, aged 28  
and 18, respectively. They were both native speakers of TK, and used the language at 
home to varying extents. Moreover, they were both bilingual in Spanish. The male 
consultant acquired the Spanish at school, while in the case of the female consultant, 
it was one of the languages she used at home as well as at school. Four individual 
sessions were carried out with each consultant, and they both participated in four 
two-participant sessions, which amounted to nearly 5h 30mins of elicitation, 
comprising 919 transcribed utterances tagged for the presence of discourse enclitics. 
 
249 
 
I am aware that having run the experiments with two participants does not allow for 
robust generalisations. Therefore, my analyses of the data obtained through 
elicitation and ‘interactive stimuli’ are always juxtaposed with language use attested 
in naturalistic discourse data to avoid hasty conclusions. The different patterns 
attested in the different types of data are also commented on. In the next section, I 
discuss problems I have en countered while carrying out the stimuli -based 
investigation of the information structure of TK. 
4.1.2.2 Methodological issues in fieldwork-based research of IS 
In this section , I concentrate on the issues that arise in the elicitation - and stimuli -
based research on IS in a fieldwork setting, on the basis of my experience of working 
on TK. This discussion is warranted by the fact that most of the studies which report 
having used stimuli for elicitation of specific phenomena tend to only report the 
experiments and elicitation tasks that were successful .38 Nonetheless, there is a lot to 
learn from the pitfalls of the elicitation and experimental tasks performed by other 
researchers.  
First, let us focus on the mismatches between certain experimental designs and the 
possibilities of carrying them out in the field. The authors of s timuli sets (e.g. Evans 
et al.  2004; Skopeteas et al. 2006)  often assume that the researcher should have 
access to  a large pol l of naïve native speakers of the  target language, who 
nonetheless have had enough formal education to  be able to engage with quite 
sophisticated interpretative conventions.  
The problems posed by the assumption that certain interpretativ e conventions are 
shared cross-culturally is perhaps most acute with video stimuli. In case of Evans et 
al. (2004), for instance, the video stimuli presented the v iewer with acted -out 
situations, which were not taken at face value even by the actors participating in 
them. The authors of these videos have taken for granted that the viewers will be able 
to treat the recorded content as abstract, and to apply it to rea l-life situations they 
have experienced, such as lice -picking. In my fieldwork experience, these 
assumptions have failed completely. The stimuli still proved useful to elicit a 
reasonably spontaneous conversation, but the topic of it was trying to guess wh at 
                                                 
38 I am thankful to Lauren Gawne (p.c., 7 Dec 2015) for suggesting it is also important to write about 
failures and misfires of elicitation and experimental research.  
 
250 
 
kind of ‘games’ the actors were playing and why. In certain videos from the QUIS 
set (Skopeteas et al. 2006) , e.g. one taking place in a bar, the intentions and 
behaviour of the protagonists were also hardly interpretable without the knowledge 
of certain cultural norms related to dating and going out, which differ gre atly 
between European university towns and rural Ecuador.  
In my experience, the experimental tasks that have worked best were ‘interactive 
tasks’ in which the speakers had something at stake. For instance, an animated , 
spontaneous conversation was elicite d by a QUIS video about theft, where the 
consultants were asked to impersonate the two characters accused of being the 
perpetrator. By asking the consultants to impersonate the characters from the film, an 
attempt was made to reduce the artificial characte r of the communicative setting, 
which, at least in this case, has worked well. A situation involving theft and 
avoidance of responsibility was easy for the consultants to identify with, since the 
issues depicted in the film are relatively universal across cultures.  
Another issue is the interpretation of graphic conventions. Cohn (2015) mentions that 
despite the fact that many ‘assume that cartoony images and the ability to understand 
sequential images is universal ’, studies show that this is in fact not the case (cf. 
Fussell & Haaland 1978). A related issue, which also came up in my fieldwork, is the 
influence of cultural factors on the interpretation of graphic conventions (San Roque 
et al. 2012:  sec. 4.3.1) . As mentioned in Section 4.1.2.1, I have worked with an 
illustrator to re -draw certain pictures from the QUIS set, so as to make them more 
easily interpretable for the consultants. At the point at which the re -drawing was 
undertaken, I had spent six months in Ecuador, but the illustrator I worked with had 
never been there. The ta sk of adapting the stimuli was much harder than both of us 
had previously imagined. I had largely underestimated the degree of detail the 
illustrator needed in order to accurately depict the simplest aspects of daily life in the 
Ecuadorian Amazon. These in cluded the sizes of items such as baskets, canoes or 
pots, manners of handling basic tools such as machetes, preparing local foods, layout 
and design of houses, types of clothing or vegetation etc. Another important issue 
was the depiction of body postures, gestures and facial expression in series of events, 
so as to induce the intended interpretation. I only became aware of how significant 
those were when I started using the stimuli with consultants.  
 
251 
 
Picture sequences turned out to pose several interpreta tive difficulties. Firstly, even 
when I explicitly mentioned that pictures were meant as a series, they were often 
interpreted as separate events. Moreover, sequential interpretation was very easily 
disrupted. In QUIS Task 2 (Skopeteas et al. 2006) , depicting various series of four 
events with the same agent, if in one o f the pictures the facial expression of the 
character suddenly changed, this was likely to disrupt the consultant’s interpretation 
of the sequence of actions the character was performing. Picture sequences involving 
an agent and a patient were also consist ently difficult to interpret, especially in case 
of actions which were only depicted partially, e.g. a mother feeding a child depicted 
as a woman reaching out with a spoon toward s the child’s mouth. Moreover, in line 
with Cohn’s (2015) observations, the consultants involved in my study sometimes 
had difficulty understanding images framed in such a way as to only depict cut off 
parts of individuals, e.g. a hand holding something.  
Despite these interpretative difficulties, using experimental tasks allowed me to gain 
insight into pragmatic structuring of discourse which would have been impossible to 
gain on the basis of analysing naturalistic discourse alone. While ‘staged 
communicative event’, which I have been calling ‘elicited discourse’ here, might 
lack a genuine communicative function (Himmelmann 1998) or be misrepresentative 
of natural language use (Lüpke 20 09), they are nonetheless a valuable source of 
linguistic data. If analysed in conjunction with naturalistic discourse and grammatical 
elicitation, elicited discourse can expand, rather than limit, our understanding of the 
structure of the language under study. 
 Previous studies of Quechua information structure 4.2
In this section, I provide a general overview of the work on information structure of 
Quechuan languages, including prosodic, morphological and syntactic marking of IS 
categories. As far as I am awar e, descriptions of IS marking in Quechuan varieties 
spoken outside Peru are very limited (see Muntendam 2015 for Bolivian Quechua ), 
and no studies exist on IS in Ecuadorian Quechua, including TK. In the paragraphs 
that follow, I summarise the main findings of the existing studies of IS mark ing in 
the Quechuan varieties for which it has been described.  
 
252 
 
In the grammatical descriptions of Quechuan varieties (cf. e.g. Parker 1969; Cerrón-
Palomino 1976; Cusihuamán 1976 /2001; Adelaar 1977; Cole 1982; Calvo Pérez 
1993), th e IS categories are discussed inasmuch as they are marked by dedicated 
suffixes/clitics. No discussion of notions such as ‘topic’ of ‘focus’ is provided, 
leaving the reader uncertain with respect to the language -specific functions of the 
topic and focus ma rkers. A notable exception in this regard is Weber’s (1989) 
description of Huánuco Quechua , which provides a detailed discussion of the 
syntactic distribution and pragmatic/IS properties of the marker -qa. While not using 
any IS-specific terms, Weber claims that -qa ‘tends to occur on constituents which 
were previously mentioned or alluded to, or are part of general knowledge’ (Weber 
1989: 400), and on constituents which are ‘the most responsible for the sentence’s 
relevance to its context’ (Weber 1989:  404). He also discusses the Huánuco 
evidentials -mi, -chi and -shi, but does not analyse them as focus markers, contrary to 
analyses provided e.g. for Tarma Quechua (Adelaar 1977) . Weber states the 
Huánuco evidentials might ‘sometimes, but certainly not always’ have the focus -
marking function (1989: 427), and introduces ‘information profile’ for Huánuco 
Quechua, whereby -qa-affixed constituents occur clause -initially, followed by 
constituents affixed with evidentials, and the inflected verb occurring after, or as one 
of the evidentially -marked elements. Verbs occur clause -finally, unless they are 
followed by a -qa-marked subject or object constituent (Weber 1989:  427–36). 
Illustrating his an alysis with examples from written texts, Weber claims that this 
pattern represents the sentence’s progression ‘from rhematic to thematic material’, 
and that deviations from it constitute a rhetorical device. 
As mentioned above, apart from Weber’s work (1989), most descriptive grammars of 
Quechuan varieties grant limited attention to IS. On the other hand, academic interest 
in marking of the IS categories in Quechuan languages has been on the rise since the 
beginning of the XXIst century. Over the course of the last decade, several 
publications devoted especially to  syntactic and morphosyntactic marking of IS in 
Quechuan languages have been published (see below). At the same time , limited 
work has been carried out on Quechua prosody and intonation in general and on 
prosodic marking of IS (but cf. O’Rourke 2009; Muntendam & Rijswijk 2014).  
 
253 
 
Muntendam (2015) looks into morphological, syntactic and prosodic means of 
expressing focus and topic in Bolivian Quechua. On the basis of data from other 
varieties, she hypothesises that Quechuan topic and focus are marked 
morphologically (via dedicated particles) and syntactically (via changes in word 
order), but not by specific pitch contours. She examines those claims with respect to 
Bolivian Quechua, and finds that in BQ focus is not marked morphologically, and the 
use of -mi, -si and -chá is considered archaic (Muntendam 2015: 222-4). This leads 
her to conclude that  in BQ the morphological marking of focus is obsolete, but has 
been lost relat ively recently, while the loss of topic marker -qa is underway (2015: 
223-4). In Sections 4.4 and 4.5 I show that if the study of TK was based only on 
elicited data, similar conclusion could be drawn. However, naturalistic TK discourse 
data reveals a different pattern. This invites the question of whether  examining data 
from naturalistic discourse on a par with data obtained through elicitation could have 
revealed a different patte rn also for BQ. On the other hand, Muntendam (2015) also 
shows that speakers’ intuitions about the markedness of morphological strategies of 
IS marking support the obsolescence hypothesis.  
Muntendam devotes most space to the discussion of prosodic marking of focus, 
checking for the corr elation of BQ foci with prosodic strategies known to be used 
cross-linguistically in focus marking: peak alignment, downstep/upstep, and intensity 
and duration of F 0. She shows that in BQ peak alignment is not used for focus 
marking, but she finds some correlations between contrastive focus on the object and 
upstepped/even peaks, and contrastive focus on the subject and downstepped peaks. 
She suggests that prosodic features of IS marking in Quechua could also be 
influenced by the consultants’ proficiency in Spanish and the prosodic strategies they 
use to mark IS in that language (2015: 240). While these results are quite preliminary, 
they are worth mentioning, since they constitute one of the very few attempts to 
analyse the prosodic marking of IS in Quechuan  languages. More research is needed 
both on the interaction of the different IS marking strategies in Quechua alone, and 
on the influence of Spanish on Quechua in this respect. 
The prosodic marking of IS is also marginally addressed by Sánchez (2010: sec. 8.2), 
who otherwise focuses on syntactic marking of IS (see below). She presents a 
preliminary analysis of intonation patterns of Southern Quechua, based on short 
 
254 
 
narrative texts, and focuses on the intonation contours of the left - and right -
peripheral constitu ents in SQ. She finds no correlation between left -peripheral 
constituents morphologically marked for IS categories and a particular intonation 
pattern. The right-detached constituents, on the other hand, ‘might be associated with 
breathy vowels and a particular intonation pattern’ (Sánchez 2010: 228). However, as 
the author herself observes, since the results she presents are preliminary and based 
on scarce data, more research is needed to confirm them. 
Morphological and syntactic marking of IS categories in Quechua, in particular in the 
Peruvian varieties , ha s been studied much more widely . Muysken (1995) grants 
primary attention to focus marking, basing his research on the data from several 
Peruvian varieties. His generative analysis concentrates on the focus function of the 
evidential/focus markers (-mi/-si/-cha). He analyses them as ambiguous between the 
focus and evidential reading, claiming that their unmarked position is on the first 
constituent on the clause, where they are ambiguous between ‘focus on the first 
constituent and no con trastive focus’ (Muysken 1995:  381). The markers can also 
occur on non -initial constituents, in which case focus only scopes over that 
constituent. The evidential force of the markers always has clausal scope. Muysken 
lists several distributional properties o f the markers, claiming that they are (1) 
constituent-external, (2) limited to one occurrence per clause, (3) restricted to main 
clauses/subordinate clauses with tensed verbs, and that they cannot occur (4) in 
imperatives, (5) on certain elements unmarked for case, i.e. manner or temporal 
adverbials, temporal nouns, (5) in clauses where the tensed verb has been deleted. He 
also claims that the markers (6) always occur on pre -verbal constituents, although he 
also cites Levinsohn’s (1975) contrary claim for Colombian Quechua (Inga). Seve ral 
of these properties were discussed for TK enclitics in  Chapter 3 . I expand on this 
discussion in Section 4.5 by relating some of Muysken’s observations to the TK data.  
Sánchez (2010) analyses IS marking in Southern Quechua, encompassing severa l 
Peruvian varieties. She explains the characteristics of evidential/focus markers put 
forward by Muysken (1995), referring to Cinque’s (1999) hierarchy of functional 
projections. Her work expands on Muysken’s analysis, taking into account 
morphological and syntactic marking of both focus and topic. She proposes that the 
syntactic restrictions on topicalised constituents are similar to those Muysken (1995) 
 
255 
 
listed as applying to focalised constituents, and explains those, too, with reference to 
functional projections. She shows that in SQ, constituents designating topics can 
occur in any position in the clause. Focal constituents, on the other hand, can occur 
clause-initially or in situ, but not post -verbally at the right edge of the clause. These 
observations were confi rmed by other authors dealing with Quechua information 
structure (cf. Cerrón-Palomino 1987; Muysken 1995; Muntendam 2015).  
According to Sánchez, topics can be morphologically marked when they occur in situ 
or clause-initially. She shows that when topical material appears post-verbally at the 
right edge of the clause, or is right-detached, it tends not to be marked 
morphologically. She argues that right -dislocated topical consti tuents are used for 
disambiguation between potential topics of sentences or discourse, produced after the 
speaker notices potential ambiguity (Sánchez 2010: 190-5). While her account of IS 
marking in SQ seems to be based on a larger corpus of elicite d data coupled up with 
naturalistic discourse, in her analysis she turns to four relatively simple narratives to 
confirm the patterns discussed above (Sánchez 2010:  ch. 8) . In two cases, the 
narratives were produced by children as Quechua re-tellings of a narrative in Spanish, 
which is potentially problematic due to the risk of L2 influence. The other two 
narratives were produced by adults as a result of picture -based storytelling tasks. It 
would be interesting to see whether the patterns of IS m arking attested in those texts 
are in line with patterns attested in naturalistic narrative discourse.  
In her more recent work , Sánchez (2015) focuses on the syntactic roles and 
interpretation of constituents at the right edge of the sentence. She argues that 
constituents at the left margin of the sentence are involved in marking the perspective 
of the speaker, including evidential and epistemic stance (Sánchez 2010: 292). The 
unmarked right-peripheral constituents, on the other hand, introduce information that 
is not central to the main top ic-focus articulation, or serves disambiguation purposes. 
These conclusions are based on the comparison of elicitation data with narratives 
based on one of the Frog Story books (Mayer & Mayer 1992) , produced by 19 
speakers of Southern Quechua. Sánchez mentions that post-verbal subjects unmarked 
with -qa are judged ungrammatical in elicitation, but do occur in discourse, and 
explains that inconsistency with the syntax -external, deictic status of the unmarked 
right-detached constituents. While Sánchez’s (2010; 2015)  observations regarding 
 
256 
 
topical constituents apply to TK (see Section 4.4), the placement of focal constituents 
seems to be more free in TK than in Peruvian varieties ( see Section 4.5), possibly 
due to the fact that the word order of TK is less strictly verb-final than the word order 
of the varieties spoken in Peru. 
In this section, I have summarised the previous studies of IS in Quechuan, granting 
particular attention to studies of syntactic and morphological marking of IS 
categories. Most descriptions coincid e in that morphological marking of topic can 
occur anywhere in the clause, while foci, whether or not morphologically marked , 
only occur pre -verbally. It is also common across varieties – and consistent with 
cross-linguistically attested patterns – that wh en both topic and focus are 
morphologically marked, topical constituents precede the focal ones. In clause-initial 
position, new foci and topic are introduced . T opical expressions occurring post -
verbally tend to serve for disambiguation purposes. In the fo llowing sections, I 
compare the above findings to the syntactic and morphological strategies of IS 
marking in TK.  
 Syntactic means of expressing IS categories in TK 4.3
As discussed in Section 4.2, previous studies of Quechua IS fo cused mostly on 
syntactic and morphological marking of IS categories. This is also the case for this 
study. Limited discussion of prosody is motivated not by the irrelevance of prosodic 
marking to the IS of TK, but rather by issues of space and available d ata. In terms of 
prosodic marking of IS, the QUIS -based elicitation has only shown that in TK, 
prosodic prominence is given to new (focal) information, or to given, but contrastive 
information (both focal and topical).  
In TK, brand new referents are intro duced into discourse by stative,  intransitive 
clauses, in which the verb ( tia-, ‘to be’) is elided. New referents are often preceded 
by the numeral shu (‘one’), used as an indefinite article. Consider: 
  (4.7)

el_01122014_02   027-30 
Example (4.7), which is an opening line from a story, shows that the indefinite article 
shu only occurs  with brand new , unidentifiable  referents. As shown by the 
ungrammaticality of shu warmi  (‘one woman’) upon its second mention, once a 
referent has been introduced into discourse, or in case it is unused, but identifiable, 
shu is ungrammatical. 
Active referents can be encoded by pronominal phrases, or elided altogether  (cf. 
Grzech 2016) . Like in other pro -drop languages, both subjects and objects can be 
elided if designating active referents which can be recovered from discourse. Inactive 
subjects must be expressed by lexical NPs, and contrastive subjects – and objects – 
must be overt (cf. Nikolaeva 2001:  27). Another strategy used to mark active 
referents is the use of the ‘same reference’ enclitic =llara:

The referents marked by =llara include, but are not limited to, topic -designating 
expressions.  
Example (4.8) also illustra tes an information structural parallel between TK and 
Cuzco Quechua (cf. Sánchez 2010; 2015) . As mentioned in Section 4.2, CQ right -
detached constituents, prosodically separate from the main clause, serve for 
disambiguation purposes. Example (4.8) shows that this is also the case in TK.  
However, while in CQ, ‘right -detached constituents always contain presupposed 
material’ (Sánchez 2010: 13), in TK they can contain non -essential new information 
which can be classified as ‘comment’ in IS terms (see Section 4.1.1), e.g. obliques 
specifying the location of core arguments: 
  (4.9)
Kay-bi     shinallara  shaya-n  shu     kari.  Chi           kari=llara  
P.DEM-LOC     as.well stand-3  one man D.DEM        man=ID.REF 
yachi-n,  wasi   mayambi. 
seem-3  house  next.to 
‘Here as well, there is a man standing. It seems [it is] the same man, next to a house.’  
el_01122014_10   063 
In (4.9), the new information conveyed by the right -detached constituent is th e 
location of the man. In sum, right -detached constituents can only contain core 
arguments if those are active in discourse, and can contain comment material, which 
is new, but not central to the proposition expressed by the clause.  Further research is 
needed to determine whether there are prosodic differences between these to types of 
right-detached expressions, as the different types of right -detached constituents have 
been attested to vary in prosody in other languages, e.g. in German (cf. Averintseva-
Klisch 2008).  
Within TK main clauses, both topical constituents and argument foci can  occur in 
any position. Both foci and topics frequently occur clause-initially:

el_27112014_01   29-32 
While all the topic -focus articulations shown above do occur, post -verbal topics are 
by far the least frequent. The QUIS elicitation data contained 245 examples of all -
new clauses 39, including 191 intransitive and 54 transitive clauses.  The VS order 
occurred in only about 14% (n=26) of intransitive clauses, and was mostly associated 
with (contrastive) focal subjects. Otherwise, the  intransitive clauses were verb -final. 
In case of transitive clauses, however, the SVO order was attested in over 40% of the 
cases (n=22), and OVS order was attested once. Although these data are only 
preliminary, they suggest that TK cannot be considered as strictly verb final as 
Peruvian Quechua varieties (cf. Muysken 1995; Sánchez 2010; 2015) . While the 
generalisations based on QUIS data allow to only draw preliminary conclusions, they 
do show that in TK the SOV order is not as dominant as in other Quechuan varieties, 
including CQ, which Sánchez (2015: 293) describes as having canonical SOV word 
order in main clauses with wide focus and overt constituents.   
The more flexible word order of TK results in more possible positions of the topical 
and focal constituents in the clause. The general pattern of occurrence of topical and 
focal constituents is similar to those described for other varieties. However, in TK 
transitive clauses, the notion of in situ marking used in other studies of Quechua IS 
becomes problematic, since object NPs can occur both pre- and post-verbally.   
Nonetheless, TK is similar to other Quechuan varieties in that the morphological 
marking of IS categories tends to appear on the left -peripheral constituents (Sánchez 
2010: 182). While the topic enclitic =ga can sometimes occur post -verbally (see 
Section 4.4), the distribution of focus -marking enclitics (see Section 4.5) is in line 
with the observations of Sánchez (2010: 36) and Muysken (1995: 383) for CQ and

‘Ecuadorian Quechua’, respectively: morphologically marked post -verbal foci have 
not been attested in the TK corpus collected to date.  
 Discourse marker =ga and topicality 4.4
This section focuses on the use of the TK discourse enclitic =ga and its correlations 
with topicality. To-date studies of topic marking in Quechua all analyse cognates of 
=ga as topic markers (see Section 3.3.2.1). On the other hand, most grammatical 
descriptions (except Weber 1989)  provide little information on  the discourse and 
grammatical contexts in which the marker occurs , and t ypical examples involve 
cognates of =ga attaching to a referential NP. Such presentation leads us to believe 
that topic marking in Quechuan is a mirror-image of the marking of aboutness topics 
in better-described languages (cf. e.g. Lambrecht 1994) . In this section, I show that 
distributional evidence from TK requires revisiting these assumptions. 
Previous studies also show that multiple constituents in the same clause can bear the 
‘topic’ marker (cf. e.g. Weber 1989; Muysken 1995; Sánchez 2010) , and establish 
that it can only occur on clausal heads  (Weber 1989 : 514; Muysken 1995:  381; 
Sánchez 2010: 43). Both these properties apply to the TK =ga (see also 3.3.2.1). 
The descriptions of the marker’s cognates attested in other varieties of Quechua also 
claim that occurrence  ‘is restricted to full main clause constituents’ (Sánchez 2010: 
43). The latter means that while =ga can occur on heads of subordinate clauses, it 
cannot occur on constituents within the subordinate clauses, e.g. a constituent within 
a nominalised subordinate clause cannot be marked with =ga. Sáchez provides the 
following example to illustrate the point:  
  (4.14)
*[Hwan-pa  papa-ta=qa   miku-sqa-n-ta     ]  yacha-ni 
   NAME-GEN potato-ACC=ga eat-NOM-3-ACC  know-1 
   Intended: ‘I know that, potatoes, Hwan eats’ 
(Adapted from Sánchez 2010: 43) 
The data suggests, however, the the restriction to occurrence on ‘full main clause 
constituents’ does not apply to the TK =ga. Consider:  
 
262 
 
  = (3.9) (4.15)
shuk  punda     maska-w,   [ washa=ga  a-k                ]RC

‘One is looking first, the one who is after, the one who is younger also [looks], apart.’  
el_16082013_02   060 
In (4.15), =ga occurs on the head of a (mini mal) AdvP within a relative clause , 
which suggests that in TK the marker is not restricted to the occurrence on 
heads/edges of the main clause constituents. However, more examples from 
naturalistic discourse, as well as grammaticality judgements, would be needed to 
check whether and how the TK =ga differs from its cognates in this respect.  
An aspect of the distribution of the cognates of =ga not considered in detail in 
previous studies is the marker’s non -obligatoriness. As mentioned in Section 3.3.2.1, 
the ‘elicited discourse’ part of the TK corpus contains 1537 turns, and 112 tokens of 
=ga. This means that the enclitic only occurred in about 7.3% of turns. While I do 
not have data about the number of syntactically marked topic s, or number of clauses 
containing topical constituents, it is reasonable to assume that the =ga-marked topics 
constitute a small percentage of all topical expressions in the TK corpus. I show 
below that while the contexts in which =ga occurs justify its a nalysis as a marker 
associated with topicality, topicality per se is not a sufficient condition to trigger the 
occurrence of the marker. 
As shown in  Table 3.2 in Section 3.3.2.1, almost 70% of the token of =ga in the 
parsed and glossed part of the corpus occur on nouns, and personal and 
demonstrative pronouns. Further 15.2 % occur on verbs, and 9.8% – on adverbs of 
place and time. The remaining 5 % attach to discourse connectives. While th e fact 
that 70 % of the tokens of =ga occur on (pro)nominal hosts is consistent with its 
interpretation as a marker of topic, the remaining 30 % is more problematic if =ga is 
to be interpreted as topic marker also in TK.  Interestingly, in the QUIS elicitatio n 
data the frequency of =ga was much higher than in other parts of the corpus: almost 
38% (n=347) of all utterances were marked with =ga. Below, I show that this 
 
263 
 
distributional difference can be explained with a much higher frequency of ‘frame -
setting’ topics in the QUIS elicitation data compared to naturalistic discourse.  
On nouns and personal pronouns, =ga does occur on topical expressions:  
  (4.16)
Shu  kuti  tia-ka   shu  ruku  runa     / *runa=ga. 
one  time exist-PST one old person / * person=ga 
Kay       runa     /  runa=ga      sacha-y      kawsa-j             a-ka.     
P.DEM     person /  person=ga    jungle-LOC   live-AG.NMLZ    COP-PST 
‘Once upon a time, there was an old man. This man used to live in the jungle.’ 
el_09122014_02 
Example (4.16) is an opening line of a story , where the occurrence of =ga on the 
expression denoting a brand -new referent was judged ungrammatical. This suggests 
that the presentative structure in the first line of (4.16) is a thetic construction, simply 
asserting the existence of an entity, rather than making a predication ‘about’ it  (cf. 
Lambrecht 1994:  138-140). Thetic construction s are topic -less, hence the 
ungrammaticality of =ga. As also shown in (4.16), once the referent had been 
introduced, marking its expression with =ga was considered grammatical, though not 
obligatory. Similarly, =ga is permissible if the referent is assumed to be situationally 
accessible, but has not been mentioned in previous discourse: 
  (4.17)
Jenny=ga       ?  
NAME=ga 
‘What about Jenny?’/ ‘Where is Jenny?’ / ‘And Jenny?’  
attested 
  (4.18)
A:   Kawsa-ngui=chu? 
       live-2=Q/NEG?  
 ‘How are you? (lit. are you alive?)’ 
 
 
 
264 
 
B:  Alli=mi   kawsa-ni.  Kan=ga   ? 
     good=mi live-1   2SG=ga 
 ‘I am well. [And] you?’ 
attested 
Utterances like (4.17) are often used in discussing family members or acquaintances, 
and can be conversation -initial. Multiple translations reflect the fact that the exact 
meaning of such utterances is highly context -dependent. In example (4.18) the 
referent of the =ga-marked expression  (2SG pronoun)  is the interlocutor, who is 
situationally evoked by default in every two-party conversation.  
In the QUIS elicitation data, all tokens of =ga on nominal hosts occurred in parallel 
structures, where more than one referent could potentially be topical. Consider (4.19), 
which is a description of Image 4.1: 
Image 4.1 Adapted stimulus from QUIS task 18 (‘Who does what’) 
 
 
 
  (4.19)

[The] man [is peeling an] orange.’ 
el_27112014_04   044-46 
In (4.19), the use of  =ga correlates with  a switch from one topic to the other.  It 
should also be mentioned that =ga occurs most often on subject and direct objects, 
which is in line with its interpretation as marker of topical status. 
In the corpus, =ga occurs on topical nouns and pronouns whe n a new topic replaces 
a previous one, or when a previously introduced topic is re -introduced (cf. Weber 
1989: 407–8; Sánchez 2010:  213 for similar usage in other varieties ). Nonetheless, 
while the enclitic is often used in the context of topic change, it is not obligatory: 
  (4.20)
Shu  ichilla  warmi     wawa    apa-mu-w-n   shu  silla-ra,  
one small woman    child      bring-CIS-PROG-3  one chair-ACC

‘A little girl is bringing a chair, and the little boy, on the other hand, is bringing a 
table.’ 
el_04122014_01   011 
Example (4.20) shows a parallel structure with two candidates for topichood, none of 
which is =ga-marked. While (4.20) is a grammatical utterance, in most cases of 
parallel structures in natural discourse at least the second candidate for topichood 
tends to be m arked with =ga. It remains to be investigated whether in cases such as 
(4.20) the topic switch is not facilitated by the discourse particle randi. The particle’s 
semantics suggests that it might facilitate the transition from one topic to another, but 
on the other hand, it can also function as host for =ga, as shown in (4.26) below. The 
 
266 
 
interaction of randi with topic switch, and the contexts in which it can and cannot be 
encliticised with =ga, require further research. 
In the naturalistic discourse corpus, =ga was also attested to occur  on multiple 
constituents within the same clause:   
  (4.21)
Wawaraga,   ñukaga,  tukuyraga,  wañushkawnandiga,  
wawa-ta=ga  ñuka=ga tukuy-ta=ga wañu-shka-guna-ndi=ga

‘The children, mine, of all of them, with the dead ones, [I] have nine in total, the 
children.’ 
 in_25052013_01   348 
While =ga occurs four times in (4.21), the expressions on which it occurs only 
denote two referents – the speaker and her children. This particular instance of the 
multiple occurrence of =ga in the same clause could be interpreted as stacked topical 
expressions, which narrow down the single topic referent - the speaker’s children. 
Multiple occurrences of =ga in one clause are infrequent in the part of the corpus 
analysed to date, and need to be examined more closely in future research.  
Parallel structures , which are the most frequent context for occurrence of =ga on 
nouns and personal pronouns,  are widely considered contrastive (cf. Repp 2010: 
1339 and references therein)  because they involve a restricted set of explicit, 
identifiable alternatives. However, while in naturalistic discourse =ga is mostly used 
on nouns in such constructions, it can also be used in cases where there is only one 
possible topical referent, as in (4.16) above. In Section 4.1.1, I introduced the 
distinction between (1) about ness-shift, (2) contrastive and (3) familiar topics 
(Frascarelli 2007: 693). While the TK =ga would be judged grammatical on all three 
types, in natural discourse it tends not to occur on familiar topics. However, 
aboutness-shift and contrastive topics can also occur without morphological marking. 
 
267 
 
While further research is needed into the communicative contexts in which =ga 
occurs, the above suggest s that the use of the enclitic on nouns and personal 
pronouns is related to both the topical status of referents and the speaker’s subjective 
perception of whether the topical referent is suffici ently salient for the interlocutor, 
and sufficiently contrastive with respect to the previous topic of discourse.  
As noted above, NPs and ProPs morphologically unmarked for topical or focal status 
can occur in any position within the main clause (see Sect ion 4.3). However, 
morphologically marked topic  expressions, but not morphologically marked 
argument focus expressions, can occur post -verbally at the right edge of the clause, 
or in right-dislocated constituents (cf. Sánchez 2010: 93).  
  (4.22)
Shinallara Jessica     y        María illa-j-kuna=ma  payguna=ga

‘Jessica and Maria as well, they don’t have anything.’ 
el_01122014_10   087 
Nonetheless, the =ga-marked phrases occur most frequently in the clause -initial 
position, as shown in examples (4.16) through (4.21).  
The marker =ga can also occur s on ‘clause external ’/’frame setting’  topics (see 
Section 4.1.1), which set spatial or temporal framework fo r the main predicate. TK 
clause-external topic expressions include adverbials, demonstrative pronouns and 
discourse connectives. In the QUIS elicitation data, 347 clauses contained 353  
instances of =ga. Of those, almost 74% (n=261) occurred on frame -setting, clause-
external topic expressions, listed in Table 4.1:

Most often, =ga occurred on the locative pronoun kay-bi. Consider (4.23) and (4.24) 
below, used by the consultant to describe Image 4.2 and Image 4.3, respectively.

Image 4.2, described by (4.23), was the first picture in a series of four, presenting a 
new subject – a woman. In (4.24), the woman is established as topical,  but the frame 
changes to another picture  (Image 4.3), prompting the occurrence of =ga on the 
locative pronoun kaybi. In the same utterance, the clause-internal topic is encoded by 
zero anaphora. However, =ga-marking on a clause -external topic does not preclude 
another occurrence of the en clitic in the same clause . Frame setting =ga-marked 
expressions can co-occur with overt clause-internal topics, also marked with =ga:  
  (4.25)

Discourse connectives like randi (‘on the other hand’) can a lso function as hosts for 
=ga. Example (4.26) comes from the same elicitation task as (4.23) and (4.24). The 
subject/topic is the same as in the examples above, but the object – and the picture 
described – change:

In (4.26), t he discourse connective which serve s as the host for =ga situates the 
predication within the framework of the previous discourse.40 This function is in line 
with setting a ‘spatial and temporal framework’ function of clause external topics . In 
(4.26), the enclitic could grammatically occur on either the connectiv e or the 
demonstrative pronoun, which suggests that the two have similar scope properties 
and functions in discourse. The topic of (4.26) is marked with the identity of 
reference enclitic =llara, which attaches to referents which remain active throughout 
a discourse, but are not necessarily topical (see Section 4.3).  
The occurrences of =ga discussed so far are in line with analysing the encl itic as a 
marker of topic shift. However, as mentioned before, =ga also occurs on verbal hosts. 
In certain varieties of Quechuan, including Cuzco, cognates of =ga only occur on 
nominalised verbs (cf. Sánchez 2010:  92). In others, like Huánuco Quechua, the 
marker is also attested on finite verbs (Weber 1989: 394, 416). In TK, =ga occurs on 
nominalised, non-finite and finite verbs. Consider:  
 = (3.7)  (4.27)
Kinri-ra          pasa-w            warmi=ga        bicicleta-y      a-j=ka,

el_25092014_02   054  
In (4.27) the enclitic occurs on two co -referential expressions denoting the topic of

clause. The occurrence of =ga on nominalised verbs is not problematic for its 
analysis as a marker associated with topic change, since nominalised verbs are 
referential (Section 4.1.1). However, =ga also occurs on non-nominalised verbs:  
  (4.28)
Pichka dollar-wa  paganun. Ña        paga-kpi=ga,    ñuka=ga  kura-ni… 
five dollar-DIM pay-3PL  already  pay-SWREF=ga 1SG=ga cure-1 
‘[The patients] pay five dollars. Now, [when they] pay, I cure [them]…’ 
in_07072013_01   166 
In (4.28), =ga occurs both on the verbal head of the subordinate clause, and on the 
topic of the main clause. Note that the subordinate verb hosting =ga was the main 
verb of the previous clause, which means it is textually accessible, and is under the 
scope of pragmatic presupposition.  
Non-nominalised verbs do not denote discourse referents, and therefore, according to 
the established definition of topichood as a property of referential expressions (see 
Section 4.1.1), should not act as hosts for topic markers. Nonetheless, it is also 
possible to view the ‘concepts’ designated by verb s, adjectives, or adverbs as akin to 
referents in that they can also be active or inactive in the minds of discourse 
participants (cf. Chafe 1976; 1987; 1994) . On the other hand, treating actions/states 
denoted by verbs as ‘concepts’ which can be activated does not resolve the problem 
with respect to the property of the deno tata of topical expressions – that propositions 
constructed about them can be judged with respect to their truth -or-falsity (see 
Section 4.1.1). A proposition cannot be constructed ‘about’ an action or state 
independently of it s arguments. On the other hand, it was also suggested in the 
literature that conditional/temporal clauses can be analysed as topics (Haiman 1978). 
It remains to be explored in further research how the treatment of conditional and 
temporal clauses as topics would affect the analysis of the TK =ga presented in this 
thesis.  
For Huánuco Quechua, Weber ob served that -qa only occurs on main verbs if the 
action denoted by the verb has been mentioned previously (cf. Weber 1989: 416 and 
references therein). In TK, speakers seem to use =ga on subordinate and main verbs 
when they consider actions denoted by them as mutually identifiable. Thi s was the 
 
272 
 
case in (4.28), where the =ga-marked action was introduced in the preceding clause. 
Much like in case of the occurrences of =ga on nominal hosts, =ga seems to be 
permissible on verbs which encode accessible concepts, irrespective of whether the 
accessibility is textual, like in (4.28), situational, or inferential. Consider: 
  (4.29)
Shinarajpi                timbrariajpiga        maskan          mochilama. 
Shina     -ra     -kpi           timbra-ria     -kpi=ga       maska-n           mochila  -ma 
like.this -make-SWREF    sound-CONT-SWREF=ga   look.for -3      backpack -DAT 
‘So when [the phone] keeps ringing, [he] searches in the backpack.’ 
el_05122014_01   027 
Example (4.29) comes from a story in which the protagonist is searching for his 
phone. When the consultant uttered (4.29), he has not previously mentioned ringing, 
but had mentioned the phone, therefore evoking a discourse frame (see Section 4.1.1) 
in which the concept of ringing can be taken as presupposed.  
Examples of =ga on subordinate verbs are infrequent in elicitation and elicited 
discourse contexts (see Section 3.3.2.1). In the QUIS elicitation data, only one of 353 
tokens of =ga occurred on a subordinate, non -nominalised verb, and two further 
tokens were attested on nominalised verbs. In both ‘elicited discourse’ (see Chapter 3) 
and QUIS data, =ga was not attested on finite verbs. The example below comes from 
the naturalistic discourse corpus:  
  (4.30)

cumuna kallari-shka-guna-ta    iya-y    chari-ni=ga

‘I remember [lit. have an idea] the ones who started the community…’41 
KICHB07AGOPEDROCHIMBO1    015 
Example (4.30) comes from an interview with a community elder, who is a n expert 
on the history of the community and is interviewed for that very reason. This 
                                                 
41 No further context following the utterance is provided he here, since after uttering (4.30), the 
speaker was interrupted by the interviewer and this discourse topic changed. 
 
273 
 
example shows that on finite verbs, =ga could be interpreted as marking a 
presupposed proposition as relevant to the current discourse.  
As discussed in Section 4.1.1, the scope of discourse enclitics, including =ga, differs 
depending on their host. When they occur on main verbs, it is ambiguous between 
predicate and clausal scope. Such broad scope can explain the multiple occurrences 
of =ga in the example below:  
  (4.31)
mana    rima-w-shka        wawa-guna-kwinta, mana    kadzu-nun=dzu  
NEG    say-PROG-ANT   child-PL-SEMBL    NEG     pay.attention-3PL=Q/NEG

‘…they [are] not like the scolded children, they don’t pay attention, they [people] say.  
 Me, because of that, at the school, [I] go ask the teachers. [I] ask [the] teachers [ not 
being sure about the children’s behaviour].’ 
in_13082013_03   001/002/004 
In (4.31) the enclitic attaches to the main verb, taking a wide scope over the entire 
predicate, and possibl y, over the entire clause . The occurrence of multiple instances 
of =ga in the clause is somewhat redundant, but could po tentially be associated with 
an emphatic effect. At this stage, this is a hypothetical interpretation. Multiple 
occurrences of =ga in the same clause and the semantic/discourse effects they bring 
about require further investigation. 
In the naturalistic discourse corpus, =ga only occurred on finite verbs with present 
time reference. Moreover, occurrences of =ga on verbal hosts seemed to be restricted 
to discourse genres such as personal narratives or ceremonial songs. Out of 90 co -
occurrences of =ga with the 1 st person present marker -ni attested in the corpus , 68 
were uttered by the same participant, a virsaru – traditional wedding singer a nd 
violin player – during a performance . The wedding chant has a specific rhythm, in 
 
274 
 
which each verse consists of four syllables, and it seems that the ‘free enclitics’ are 
often used in such songs more liberally than in other discourse genres, as the y allow 
the singer to fill in the gaps in the rhythm.  
The examples above show that occurrences of =ga on non-nominalised verbal hosts 
correlate with the IS category of ‘background’ (see Section 4.1.1): presupposed, but 
not thematic content, specifying details which might be necessary for a complete 
understanding of focused information (Butt & Holloway King 2000).  
In this section, I have shown that the occurrences of the enclitic =ga in TK discourse 
correlate with different types of topic structures. The marker occurs on aboutness and 
contrastive topics, as well as on frame -setting topics and backgroun ded constituents. 
Nonetheless, the marker is relatively infrequent, as it only occurs on about 7% of the 
turns in the parsed and glossed part of the corpus. This low frequency suggests that 
=ga should not be interpreted as a topic marker, but rather, as a marker associated 
with topicality, and particularly, with topic change. Consequently, the  TK =ga could 
be analysed as a marker of presupposed content which the speaker wishes to make 
salient to the addressee, or which contrasts with other presupposed infor mation. 
However, further research is needed to spell this analysis out in more detail. Above, I 
have shown that one of the contexts in which speakers tend to add saliency to 
presupposed material and indicate that it is contrastive are parallel structures, but it is 
not yet clear what motivates the occurrence of =ga in other construction types.  
 Discourse markers and focus 4.5
In this section, I discuss the IS function of the discourse enclitics associated with 
different types of foci . The enclitics in question are: =mi, =ma, =mari, =tá, =chu, 
=cha, and =ta. In Chapter 3, I have discussed their morphosyntactic properties, and 
here I focus on the aspects of their meaning related to  their association with the 
category of focus.  
 =mi and the marking of focus 4.5.1
In previous descriptions of Quechuan focus marking (see Section 4.2), most attention 
has been granted to the focus/‘direct evidential’ enclitic =mi (cf. e.g. Muysken 1995; 
 
275 
 
Weber 1986; Floyd 1997; Sánchez 2010) . The basic morphosyntactic properties of 
=mi were described in  Section 3.3.2.2. It was also mentioned (see  Table 3.1 in 
Section 3.3.1) that in the elicited discourse corpus, the marker only occurred in about 
7% of turns (n=108).  In the QUIS elicitation data, its frequency is even lower, as it 
only occurs in 0.7% of utterances (n=7). Such low frequencies suggest that the use of  
the marker is not conditioned exclusively by the topic -focus articulation. In this 
section, I also mention other enclitics related to focus:  =ma and =mari, which, in 
some discourse contexts, seem to occur interchangeably with =mi. The semantic and 
pragmatic issues pertinent to the description of =mi, and, to a lesser extent, =ma and 
=mari, are discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.  
In TK, like in other Quechuan, =mi tends to occur on the first constituent of the 
clause (cf. Levinsohn 1975  for Inga/Colombian Quechua  (QII); Floyd 1997  for 
Wanka Quechua (QI); Muysken 1995 for 'Ecuadorian Quechua'  (QII); and Sánchez 
2010 for 'Southern Quechua' (QII)). The exchange in (4.32) gives an example of =mi 
used contrastively, while (4.33) is an example of non-contrastive subject focus:  
  (4.32)

in_03072013_02    048-9 
 
276 
 
According to Muysken (1995: 381) , when =mi occurs clause -initially, it is 
ambiguous between focus on the first constituent and no contrastiv e focus, while in 
other positions it triggers a focal interpretation of its host . While this obtains for TK, 
the contrastive interpretation arises in discourse contexts where a relevant set of 
alternatives can be identified (Repp 2010: 1336) , rather than due to morphological 
marking. Therefore, it is sufficient to say that when occurring on arguments and 
adjuncts, the enclitic only scopes over the constituent on the head of which it occurs.  
In other varieties, when =mi occurs in the same clause with =ga, the =mi marked 
constituent obligatorily follows the =ga-marked material (cf. e.g. Floyd 1997:32; 
Weber 1989b; Muysken 1995:385; Sánchez 2010 for more details). While this is also 
often the case in TK, example (4.34) shows that this order is not obligatory. 
  (4.34)
Mana.   Warmi=mi        chura-ri-n   ñuka-j-pi=ga. 
NEG     woman=mi      put   -ANTIC-3 1SG-BEN-LOC=ga 
‘No. The woman [not the man] wears [the headphone] in mine [my video].’ 
el_05122014_01   023 
Example (4.34) comes from a discussion about differing videos consultants have 
prior to the exchange. In this case, =ga attaches to a possessive pronoun functioning 
as a frame -setting expression, and the =mi-marked constituent is contrastive. It 
remains to be investigated whether =mi occurring before =ga is related to a 
particular topic-focus articulation.  
A distributional property which the TK =mi does share with its cognates i s that it 
never occurs post-verbally (cf. Muysken 1995: 383; Sánchez 2010) . As discussed in 
Section 4.3, post-verbal focal constituents are attested in TK, but, as far as the data 
show, cannot be marked by =mi, =ma, or =mari. In the 13h corpus of naturalistic 
discourse, not one instance of those enclitics on a post-verbal constituent was attested.  
Nonetheless, =mi and the other two enclitics can occur clause -finally on verbs, or on 
non-verbal predicates, in which the copula is often elided:  
 
 
 
277 
 
  (4.35)

3SG  woman -PL =mi     
‘[They are] their wives…’ 
el_16082013_01    160 
When occurring on non -verbal predicates, as well as on tensed verbs, =mi triggers 
predicate focus interpretation (cf. Sánchez 2010: 62-4). Consider:  
  (4.36)
Q: Ima-ra   ra-w-ngui?  
          what-ACC do-PROG-2

          manioc-ACC=mi eat-PROG-1 
Q:  ‘What are you doing?’ 
A:  ‘I’m eating manioc.’ 
elicited 
The question in (4.36) elicits a broad focus of the corresponding answer. The 
answering utterance can be constructed without a focus enclitic, as in (4.36a), or with 
=mi attaching to the verb, as in  (4.36b). The occurrence of the enclitic on the 
argument, as in  (4.36c), is not felicitous in this context, since the scope of =mi on 
NPs is narrow (see Section 4.1.1). The reverse situation is exemplified in (4.37), 
where the question elicits a narrow focus on the argument. 
  (4.37)
Q:  Ima-ra   miku-w-ngui?

c. #Lumu-ra   miku-w-ni=mi 
   manioc-ACC  eat-PROG-1=mi 
Q:  ‘What are you eating?’ 
A:  ‘I’m eating manioc.’ 
elicited 
Since the ac tion of eating corresponds to background, rather than focus,  (4.37c) is 
not felicitous in this discourse context. The issue of the non -obligatoriness of =mi in 
both examples is discussed below.  
The enclitic =mi can attach to c onstituents of main clauses, but it can also occur in 
subordinate clauses (see Section  3.2.2). In such cases, it occurs on the head of the 
subordinate clause, and the whole subordinate clause is under the scope of focus. 
Example (4.38) showcases a manner clause, headed by a nominalised verb:  
  (4.38)
yarka-y    wañu-w=mi      miku-n. 
be.hungry-OBJ.NMLZ die-PROG=mi  eat-3 
‘He eats dying of hunger.’ 
in_20092013_04   083 
According to Muysken (1995: 383), Quechua focus markers/evidentials cannot occur 
in gapping structures when the verb has been deleted. This is not the case in TK:  
  (4.39)
Tsarpundza    maña-n.  Tsatsa-ra=mi     asta-nga     ra-w-n,               shina

‘He asked [for the wheelbarrow] the day before yesterday. He will load sand, he said, 
maybe to make the house, [to make] the kitchen.’   
ev_24052013_01   020 
The verb in brackets was elided in the utterance of (4.39). Muysken (1995: 383) 
takes the ungrammaticality of =mi in gapping structures as possible evidence that the 
marker needs to be ‘supported by a tensed verb in S-structure’. Example (4.39) 
shows that this claim does not obtain for TK , but further discussion of the issue is 
beyond the scope of this thesis.  
The enclitic =mi also occurs on discourse connectives, e.g. on the lexicalised 
collocation chiragu (D.DEM-CAUS). Syntactic ally, chirayugu is a causal adjunct, 
but in the example above it also function as a causal connective indicating 
consequence:  
  (4.40)
Ashka     llanganarami     charini,   
ashka      llanga -na    -ta     =mi    chari -ni

D.DEM -CAUS =mi   NEG    can   -1 
‘I have a lot of work, that is why I cannot. (response to a request of taking someone 
to the other side of the river with a canoe).’ 
el_02102013    191 
In (4.40), two finite clauses are coordinated (see Section  2.5.3.1). Within the first 
clause, the argument is in focus. The second occurrence of =mi is on the connective, 
due to the fact that  it is the causal relationship between the clauses, rather than their  
propositional content, that falls within the scope of the assertion  in the second clause 
(cf. Lambrecht 1994: 58). Discourse connectives take discourse units/clauses as their 
 
280 
 
arguments (Creswell et al. 2005) . Consequently, it could be assumed that =mi on the 
connective also has clausal scope. However, the scope properties of =mi and other 
discourse enclitics when occurring on discourse connectives need to be investigated 
in detail in the future.  
The examples above show the contexts in which =mi can grammatically occur. 
However, in none of them is the presence of =mi required for grammaticality. The 
data suggest that =mi is only syntactically obligatory in corrective contexts:  
  (4.41)
Mana  ñuka  ushi=chu,   ñuka  warmi=mi.  /  *warmi 
NEG 1SG daughter=Q/NEG 1SG woman=mi /  *woman 
‘[She is] not my daughter, [she is] my wife.’

‘[(S)he] didn't stand up, they were just sitting there facing each other.’ 
el_24112014_01   041 
The corrective constructions exemplified above are contrastive, since the =mi-
marked constituent stands in an explicit contrast to a relevant set of  alternatives (cf. 
Repp 2010) . In TK corrective focus structures, these alternatives are overt. 
Correction involves rejection of an alternative proposition which is under discussion, 
or forms part of Common Ground (see Section 4.1.1). 
While =mi occurs in contrastive and corrective contexts, it does not have an 
exhaustive meaning. Rather, it seem s to indicate ‘weak exclusion’ (Molnár 2006: 
220), whereby the proposition does not hold for at least one from the set of relevant 
alternatives. Exhaustivity is encoded by the limitative marker =lla, as shown in the 
contrast between the answers (4.43a) and (4.43b): 
 
281

el_05122014_09   109 
As far as the data show, =ma and =mari are similar to =mi in this respect, and they 
too, do not encode exhaustivity.   
The enclitics =ma (see Section 3.3.2.3) and =mari (see Section 3.3.2.4) also share 
the syntactic properties of =mi discussed above. Both are less frequent in discourse 
than =mi (see Table 3.1 in Section 3.3.1), but also occur on focal constituents, often 
interchangeably with =mi. Consider:  
  (4.44)

As mentioned in Section 3.3.2.1, the en clitic =m, which occurs on  non-verbal and 
complex verbal predicates, is ambiguous between =mi and =ma:  
  (4.46)
Ña,  kay-bi          randi.     ñuka-j-pi         randi   warmi            =m a-ka.

el_05122014_01   070 
The problems with  disambiguation are due to the fact that both enclitics occur in 
similar discourse contexts. They can both be used for identification focus as in (4.44), 
and in contrastive contexts:  
  (4.47)
A: Mana,    warmi...  warmi...   warmi   apa-ka.

Example (4.47) is of corrective focus, since speaker B is contradicting the claim 
made by A as to who stole the watch in a video they have both seen.  
At this stage, there is not enough data available to provide a satisfactory description 
of the IS functions of =ma or =mari. Both enclitics seem to be non -obligatory focus 
markers, but it is not possible at this stage to determine the condition s under which 
 
283 
 
they might be more likely to be used in discourse than =mi. In previous descriptions 
of Quechuan, Cusihuamán (1976/2001: 231) analysed the ‘impressive’ -má as a 
focalising particle, while Sánchez (2010: 83) claimed that rather than marking focus, 
-ma is a marker of ‘evaluative mood’ (Cinque 1999:  56), encoding  the speaker’s 
perspective with respect to the event. The non -IS aspects of the meaning of =ma and 
=mari are discussed in more detail in Section 5.4. 
In this section, I have focused on the IS function of  the enclitic  =mi. The data 
suggests that while all occurrences of =mi are on focal constituents, it is only 
obligatory where the focal content stands in opposition to the content assumed by the 
hearer to be part of CG.  The fact that the marker is felicitous in both contrastive and 
non-contrastive contexts, however, is an argument against analysing it as a marker 
associated solely with ‘contrastive focus’. Therefore, the description of the IS role of 
=mi is not sufficient to satisfactorily account for its distribution. In the following 
chapters, I attempt to provide a more complete picture of the discourse context s in 
which =mi can and cannot occur. In  Chapter 5 , I focus on the marker’s epist emic 
meaning, showing that the epistemic semantics of the marker allows to determine in 
which contexts the speaker s chooses to use =mi, rather than the other markers 
associated with focus, which encode different epistemic values. In Chapter 6, I show 
how the occurrence of the marker is further conditioned by (1) the  expectations of 
the speaker relative to the knowledge sta te and expectation of the addressee,  and (2) 
specificity of the CG update provided by a given constituent.  
 Verum focus and the marker =tá 4.5.2
In Section 3.3.2.5, I discussed the morphosyntactic properties of the ma rker =tá. It 
was only attested seventeen times in the corpus, but on the basis of the naturalistic 
discourse data coupled up with elicitation basic conclusions can be reached with 
respect to the enclitic’s IS function of marking verum focus (see Section 4.1.1). 
Firstly, notice that =tá is not felicitous in answers to content questions:  
  (4.48)
Q:  Ima-ra   ra-w-ngui ? 
      what-ACC do-PROG-2   
       ‘What are you doing?’ 
 
284 
 
a. Miku-w-ni=mi  
eat-PROG-1=mi 
‘I am eating.’  
b. #Miku-w-ni=rá 
     eat-PROG-1=tá 
         ‘I AM eating.’ 
el_28112014_05 
In answers to polar question, on the other hand, =tá is felicitous, and its function 
seems to be strengthening the polarity of the clause:   
  (4.49)
Q:  Miku-w-ngui=chu ? 
          eat-PROG-2=Q/NEG 
 ‘Are you eating?’  
A: Mikuwnirá      /  #Mikuwnimi 
          miku-w-ni=tá       /   miku-w-ni=mi 
   eat-PROG-1=tá     /         eat-PROG-1=mi 
 ‘I AM eating.’  
el_28112014_05    
While =mi is rejected in answers to polar questions in translation and fe licity 
judgement tasks, it does occur in answers to polar questions in more natural 
discourse. Compare (4.50) and (4.51): 
  (4.50)

 ‘Yes, he has an apple, a red apple, and he also has…[he] has a plate of soup.’  
el_01122014_08   133-34 
The fact the both =tá and =mi can be used in this context does not invalidate the 
verum focus analysis of =tá. Rather, it shows that answers to polar interrogatives in 
TK can have different foc us structures, depending on the communicative intentions 
of the speaker (see Section 6.1). It also suggests that these intentions are more likely 
to come into play in contexts that are ‘genuinely communicative’ than in elicitat ion. 
The examples above also show that =tá, like =mi (see Section 4.5.1), does not have 
an exhaustive meaning.  
A property that =tá shares with verum focus marking described for other languages 
(see Section 4.1.1) is that it can only occur on textually evoked propositions:  
  (4.52)
A:  kam-ba   warmi   may-bi=ra              [a-n] ? 
 2SG-GEN woman  where-LOC=INT       [be-3] 
 ‘Where is your wife?’ 
 
286 
 
B:  wasi-y=mi            /  *wasi-y=rá 
 house-LOC=mi    /    house-LOC=tá 
 ‘[She is] at home.’ 
A:  wasi-y=cha ?  
 where-LOC=cha 
 ‘At home?’ 
B: wasi-y=rá ! 
          house-LOC=tá 
 ‘Yes, [she IS] at home!’ 
el_28112014_05  
In (4.52), =tá is not felicitous on B’s first utter ance, with which he introduces the 
proposition that his wife it at home into discourse. However, = tá is felicitous in the 
second utterance. This suggests that =tá is only felicitous on propositions previously 
introduced into discourse, which correspond to Questions Under Discussion (cf. 
Gutzmann & Castroviejo Miró 2011) . The use of =tá marks these propositions as 
information which, according to the speaker, should be added to CG (cf. Romero & 
Han 2004) . It remains to be investigated whether =tá can occur on answers to 
questions which were not mentioned in the previous discourse, but rather introduced 
into the set of QUD by virtue of the situational context.  
In languages like German, verum focalisation is attested in all major clause types : 
declaratives, interrogatives and imperatives (cf. e.g. Höhle 1992) . In TK, the marker 
=tá only occurs in declarative clauses with positive polarity: 
  (4.53)
Q: kullki-ra  mana  chari-ngui=chu ? 
 money-ACC NEG have-2(=Q/NEG) 
 ‘Don’t you have money?’  
a. chari-ni=rá 
have-1=tá 
‘I DO have [money].’ 
 
 
287 
 
b. mana   chari-ni=chu /       mana chari-ni=mi  / *mana  chari-ni=rá  
NEG   have-1=Q/NEG /  NEG  have-1=mi       NEG have-1=tá 
‘I don’t have [money].’ 
el_28112014_05 
The pattern attested in (4.53) was confirmed by the fact that =tá was not attested on 
negative polarity clauses in the corpus. However, a corpus containing more instances 
of =tá, as well as judgements of grammaticality, are  needed to make this conclusion 
more robust.  
In (4.52), =tá attaches to a non -verbal host which functions as  a head of a locative 
predicate. In the corpus, the enclitic attaches to non-verbal hosts only if they function 
as heads of non-verbal predicates (see Section 3.3.2.5). Consider:  
 = (3.46) (4.54)
A:  Ishki  Venecia tia-n ?

 ‘Are there two [villages called] Venecia?’

 ‘[That’s] that.’

 now=ga  drink-INF=Á 
 ‘Yes, now [one] has to drink it.’  
in_05092014_03   088-091 
Example (4.55) comes from a conversation about preparing a plant remedy. Both 
utterances of B are verum-focalised, but only the first one bears the marker =tá. In 
the second utterance, a lexical stress shift occurs on the verb, whereby the last, rather 
than penultimate syllable is stressed. Parker (1969) analysed this type of stress shift 
in Ayacucho Quechua as morphological marking (see Section  3.3.1), and the gloss  
‘=Á’ in (4.55) is adopted from his work.  In TK, stress shift occurs on the rightmost 
element of the clause in context s similar to those in which =tá is attested, and the 
main function of both =tá and the word -stress shift seems to be emphasising the 
polarity of the proposition. Consider another example from naturalistic discourse:  
  (4.56)
A: Kay-ta   mana   piti-na=ra  ni-ngui=cha  kasna=y  ? 
 P.DEM-ACC  mana  cut-INF=ta say-2=cha like.this=y 
 ‘This, we don’t need to cut, just like this?’ 
B:  Piti-ná... 
 cut-INF=Á 
 ‘[We] DO have to cut [it].’ 
in_24092014_03   097-8 
In the data collected to date, both the stress shift and =tá can occur in the same 
environments, e.g. on verbs in the infinitive. In (4.55) and (4.56) the infinitive verb is 
affected by word -stress shift, and in the example below, it acts as hosts for =tá in a 
similar context:  
  (4.57)
A: Apachijllara       pambana? 
 apa-chi-j=llara      pamba-na 
 bring-CAUS-AG.NMLZ=ID.REF   bury-INF 
 ‘[So] the midwife herself have to bury [the placenta]?’  
 
289 
 
B: Apachijllara     pambanará. 
 apa-chi-j=llara    pamba-na=tá  
 bring-CAUS-AG.NMLZ=ID.REF bury-INF=tá 
 ‘Yes, [she] does have to bury [it] herself.’ 
in_08102014_02   164-165 
The currently available data does not allow reaching a conclusion about whether the 
word-stress shift to the last syllable and =tá are indeed allomorphs, or to establish 
whether they can be analysed as occurring  in complementary distrib ution. At this 
stage, it is also unclear whether, contrary to =tá, lexical stress shift might be 
compatible with negative polarity contexts. If this was the case, it could be concluded 
that the verum -focalisation is the function of the stress shift, while the enclitic =ta 
can co-occur with the stress shift, and contributes a different meaning to the clause. 
Further research into =tá could be informed by typological comparison with markers 
encoding similar meanings in other languages. A possible object of co mparison 
identified at this s tage is a mə(r)=: an existential quantifier used to mark realis in 
Tundra Yukaghir (isolate, north -eastern Siberia , Matić & Nikolaeva 2014) . There 
seem to be a number of distributional and semantic parallels between =tá and mə(r)=, 
which I intend to explore in future research.  
In sum, the data show that the marker =tá plays a role in verum focus marking. 
However, its occurrence in discourse is infrequent, which suggests that additional 
factors, possibly related to the speake r’s subjective judgements, which cannot be 
accounted for in IS -terms, also motivate its occurrence. In  Chapter 5, show that the 
verum focus semantics of =tá suggests that, like =mi, the marker encodes an 
‘epistemic primacy’ meaning. In Chapter 6, I develop this account, showing that =tá 
and =mi differ in terms of the expectation -related values they encode. By doing so, I 
show how the felicity of TK verum focus marking is related to ‘the interlocutors ’ 
epistemic biases towards one of the answers to the question under discussion’ 
(Gutzmann & Castroviejo Miró 2011:  164). In a comparative perspective  the 
discourse function of =tá is similar to the Southern Quechua ‘certainty enclitic’ 
=puni (Rosaleen Howard, p.c. 29/09/2016, cf. e.g. Faller 2006), and further research 
should explore the semantic (dis)similarities between the two markers.

 Focus, polar questions, and negation: the enclitic =chu 4.5.3
The enclitic =chu is a polar question and negation marker , which also plays a role in 
focus marking (cf. Muysken 1995:  388-90; Sánchez 2010:  73). Its basic 
morphosyntax was described in  Section 3.3.2.6. The current section focuses on the 
role =chu plays in IS, and on its interaction with negation. While in the elicited 
discourse corpus =chu occurred on almost 3% of utterances (see  Section 3.3.1), in 
the QUIS data it only occurred in 0.033% of turns (n=3). Other interrogative focus 
enclitics were also barely present in that part of the corpus.  
Unlike any of the othe r TK discourse enclitics, =chu occurs in all three main clause 
types: declaratives, interrogatives and imperatives. In declarative clauses, it delimits 
the scope of negation and it occurs on focal constituent. In interrogatives, it occurs 
on constituents c orresponding to the focus of the equivalent declarative clause. In 
imperatives, it delimits the scope of the prohibitive particle ama.  
In declarative clauses, =chu co-occurs with the negative particle mana to delimit the 
scope of negation  (see Section 3.3.2.6). The particle mana precedes the negated 
material, while =chu follows it:  
  (4.58)

‘“You’ve grown up not being punished much”, my mother who raised me used to tell 
me off.’ 
in_01082013_05   295 
 
291 
 
In (4.58), the entire predicate is under the scope of negation, while in (4.59) it only 
scopes over an AdvP, modifying the manner adjunct. Similarly to other focus 
enclitics, when =chu occurs on nominal elements in utterances lacking a tensed verb, 
the nominal is interpreted predicatively (cf. Sánchez 2010: 74 for the same pattern in 
CQ). Consider: 
  (4.60)
kay   ambi=ga  mana  alli  ambi=chu 
P.DEM medicine=ga NEG good medicine=Q/NEG 
‘These medicines are not good medicines.’ 
KICHB07AGOPEDROCHIMBO2   405

NEG 1SG  daughter=Q/NEG 1SG  woman=mi  
‘[She is] not my daughter, [she is] my wife.’ 
el_28112014_05 
Examples (4.60) and (4.61) also demonstrate that =chu plays a role in focus marking. 
In the equative predicate in (4.60), mana and =chu delimit the scope of both negation 
and focus, while the topical constituent kay ambi (‘D.DEM medicine’) is marked by 
the ‘topic’/presupposed content marker =ga. In (4.61), =chu participates in a 
corrective focus construction, highlighting the negated nominal predicate, while the 
corresponding corrective portion of the utterance is marked with =mi.  
In certain discourse contexts, e.g. in negative answers to polar questions, =chu and 
=mi can occur interchangeably:  
 = (4.53) (4.62)
Q: kullki-ra  mana  chari-ngui=chu ? 
 money-ACC NEG have-2=Q/NEG 
 ‘Don’t you have money?’  
a. mana   chari-ni=chu             
NEG   have-1=Q/NEG  
 
292 
 
b. mana chari-ni=mi   
NEG  have-1=mi  
‘I don’t have [money].’  
el_28112014_05 
Both answers are felicitous and appropriate in the same discourse circumstances. In 
Chapter 5, I discuss the epistemic considerations that might motivate the choice of 
one enclitic over the other, but in terms of IS, (4.62a) and (4.62b) are equivalent.  
Another distributional property which =chu shares with other discourse enclitics 
discussed thus far is syntactic non-obligatoriness.    
  (4.63)
kan   gustu-ra  ra-ngui,  ñuka   mana   usha-ni. 
2SG  nice-ACC do-2  1SG  NEG  can-1

‘How do you do [that]? I can’t/am not able to [do that].’  
in_20092013_02   033-34 
Examples is (4.63) and (4.64) were uttered by the same speaker in a s imilar situation 
– cooking a traditio nal dish – but =chu only occurs in the latter. The non -
obligatoriness of =chu is confirmed by examples from the corpus, which show that 
=chu is non -obligatory both as a focus marker and as a polar question/negative 
particle.  
In directive clauses, =chu also interacts with negation. It (non-obligatorily) occurs in 
prohibitive constructions involving the particle ama:  
 
 
 
293 
 
  (4.65)
uya-ni=mi  señora,   ama   llaki-pa-y=chu  ! 
hear-1=mi lady  PROH  be.sad-INTEN-IMP=Q/NEG 
‘I  hear [you] ma’am, don’t worry!’ 
ev_04102013_07   007 
As mentioned above, =chu is the only discourse marker which can grammatically 
occur in imperative clauses. A tentative explanation for this distributional property of 
=chu is discussed in Chapter 5. 
As mentioned above, =chu can also occur in positive polarity declarative clauses. In 
the absence of the negative particle mana, =chu does not mark negation, but is 
associated with focal status of constituents, and indicates that the utterance should 
receive dubitative/rhetorical question interpretation:  
  (4.66)
Shina       ansa    awa-w=dzu,     usa-ra=chu            
like.this   little  weave -PROG=Q/NEG lice-ACC=Q/NEG

‘Like this a little bit, is [she] making a braid, or looking for lice or what, I don't know, 
to be true...’ 
el_16082013_02   044 
In TK, the interrogative mood is marked by means of intonation and – optionally – 
by the presence of discourse enclitics. In (4.66), although =chu is present, the 
intonation is declarative, and hence the utterance is interpreted as a rhetorical 
question. Declarative clauses marked by =cha and =chari receive similar 
interpretation (see Section 4.5.4).  
The final contexts in which =chu tends to occur are polar interrogative clauses, 
although there too, it is not grammatically obligatory: 
 
 
294 
 
  (4.67)
a. riku-ngui ? 
 see   -2 
b. riku-ngui=chu ?  
 see-2=Q/NEG 
 ‘Do you/can you see [that]?’  
elicited 
In polar questions, =chu always occurs on predicative elements, which could suggest 
that is should be analysed as an interrogative equivalent of the verum marker =tá 
(see Section 4.5.2). However, =chu does not share the properties of =tá in that it is 
felicitous in out-of-the-blue utterances containing brand new information. 
The analysis of =chu as a polar question marker is confirmed b y its 
ungrammaticality in content questions:  
  (4.68)
a. may-ma   ri-w-ngui  ? 
 where-DAT go-PROG-2 
‘Where are you going?’ 
b. may-ma     =ra   ri-w-ngui ?

c. *may-ma   ri-w-ngui=chu ? 
         where-DAT go-PROG-2=Q/NEG 
d. *may-ma=chu   riwngui ? 
         where-DAT=Q/NEG go-PROG-2 
el_28112014_05 
Examples (4.68c) and (4.68d) show that =chu cannot occur in content questions, 
which, as illustrated in  (4.68b), are marked by the content question enclitic =ta (see 
Section 4.5.5).  
 
295 
 
This section showed that =chu functions as a focus marker, delimiting the scope of 
negation, and as a polar question marker. Like other enclitics discus sed in this 
chapter, it is non -obligatory, which suggests that its distribution is not motivated 
solely by IS -related factors. It remains to be investigated which aspects of the 
communicative contexts, or subjective evaluations thereof, prompt speakers to use 
=chu in discourse. In  Chapter 5 , I discuss the epistemic considerations regarding 
=chu, and compare its use in discourse with that of another marker associated with  
focus, which tends to occur in similar contexts: =cha,.  
 Focus, polar question and doubt: =cha and =chari  4.5.4
The enclitic =cha is functionally similar to = chu: it marks focal constituents in polar 
interrogatives and certain types of declaratives. Contrary to =chu, =cha does not 
interact with negation. In other Que chuan varieties the enclitic has been analysed as 
both a focus m arker and an inferential/conjectural evidential  (see Section 5.2.2). 
Here, I describe its association with focus . I also briefly discuss another focus 
enclitic, =chari (see Section  3.3.2.8), which shares many distributional properties 
with =chu and =cha.  
The enclitic =cha occurs in polar questions, where, similarly to =chu, it marks 
constituents corresponding to the focus of the subsequent answer: 
  (4.69)
Q:  Alli=cha    kasna-y=ga          ?   o... yapa  ashka=chu       ? 
      good=cha   like.this-LOC=ga   or much many=Q/NEG 
A:  Alli=mi 
     good=mi 
Q:   ‘Is it good up to here? Or [is it] too much [filling]?’ 
A:  ‘[That’s] good.’

     bitter=tá 
Q:  ‘[is it a] bitter leaf?’ 
A:  ‘[it IS]  bitter’ 
in_05092014_01   033-34 
In polar questions, as far as focus marking is concerned, =chu and =cha occur in free 
variation. This gives rise to ambiguities similar to those described for =mi and =ma 
(see Section 4.5.1), in cases where the focus marker occurs as a proclitic on the 
tensed element of a complex/non-verbal predicate:  
  (4.71)
Kam-ba  mama=s   shina    ch=a-ka,   partera  ? 
2SG-GEN mother=ADD  like.this   =chu/=cha-COP-PST midwife 
‘Was your mother also like [this], a midwife?’ 
in_08102014_03   047 
In (4.71), the procliti c ch= can be disambiguated as either =chu or =cha. While in 
terms of focus marking the two are equivalent, disambiguation might be based on the 
difference in the markers’ epistemic meaning (see Section 5.3.5). 
When occurring in  declarative clauses, =cha – again, similarly to =chu – triggers a 
dubitative/rhetorical question interpretation of the utterance:  
  (4.72)

However, when functioning as a rhetorical question/dubitative marker, =cha is 
permissible in a broader range of contexts than =chu. While =chu is ungrammatical 
with interrogati ve pronouns (see  (4.68d) above), =cha does co -occur on them in 
declarative contexts:  
  (4.73)
Payska                 maytacha              rinawn, 
pay    =s        =ga      may    -ta     =cha      ri -nun

‘They too...where could they be going, they are going far, those kids.’ 
el_24092014_03   075 
Depending on the context , utterances like (4.73), can be interpreted as rhetorical 
questions, dubitative statements, or expression s of lack of knowledge, where =cha 
always attaches to the focal const ituent. I discuss these constructions in more detail 
in Section 5.3.4 within the analysis of the epistemic meaning of =cha.  
Another interrogative focus marker with distributional properties similar to =chu and 
=cha is =chari. It occurs less frequently than the other two enclitics – in the elicited 
discourse corpus, it was only attested on about 1% of utterances (n=16). In the QUIS 
corpus, it occurred on 0.05% of utterances  (n=5). Where it does occur, =chari, like 
=chu and =cha, marks focus in polar interrogatives and in dubitative 
statements/rhetorical questions. 
  (4.74)

‘[As for you], you have an ID card?’ 
in_25052013_1_01    327 
 
298 
 
In (4.74), =chari is used in a polar question. Both =chu and =cha could also 
grammatically occur in that utterance. While =chari attaches to the verb, indicating 
that the predicate is in the scope of focus, the subject of the clause is marked with  the 
topic/presupposed content marker =ga.  
In rhetorical questions, =chari patterns similarly to =cha in that it is grammatical on 
interrogative pronouns: 
  (4.75)

‘And although there used to be no vaccines [people did not get ill], how could that be, 
that [is what] I don’t understand.’ 
in_13082013_02   070 
In Section 3.3.2.8, I mention that =chari has previously been analysed as an 
emphatic version of =cha. At present, there is not enough data to prove or disprove 
this hypothesis for TK. Nonetheless, the data show that the two enclitics are 
distributionally and functionally similar.  
In this section, I have outlined the IS -related properties of =cha and =chari. While 
they both occur on focal constituents in interrogative and declarative contexts, as all 
the markers discussed previously, they are not obligatory. I n Section 5.3, I show that  
the occurrence of both enclitics seems to be related to the speaker’s epistemic 
considerations and that they seem to be used for attenuation, in contexts where the 
speaker is unwilling to commit to their epistemic evaluation of the state of affairs.

 Focus in content questions: =ta 4.5.5
The enclitic =ta (see Section 3.3.2.9) marks focal constituents in content questions. It 
always occurs on the constituent corresponding to the focus of the subsequent answer:  
 = (3.79) (4.76)
Pitara              munangay,         pay ? 
pi      -ta     =ta     muna   -nga=y    pay

‘What do you cook and drink it for, what is that [medicine] good for?’  
in_25052013_1_01    027 
While in elicitation context s consultants always judged =ta grammatical on focal 
constituents of wh -questions, including interrogative pronouns, in naturalistic 
discourse content questions without =ta are also grammatical. Consider:  
  (4.78)
a. ima  shuti=ra  a-ngui ?  
what name=ta be-2 
b. ima  shuti   a-ngui ? 
what name  be-2 
‘What’s your name (lit. what name are you?)’ 
attested 
While the proportion of =ta-marked content question s in the corpus has not been 
counted, in the elicited discours e corpus the marker has only occurred in 1.8% of 
utterances (n=28). The speakers tend to use =ta when they consider that the focal 
constituent needs to be highlighted, but the communicative contexts conducive to the 
 
300 
 
use of such highlighting are yet to be i nvestigated. Speakers can also mark focus in 
content question with =mi. Compare (4.79) to (4.78) above:  
   (4.79)
Ima  shuti=mi ? 
what name=mi 
‘What [is her] name?’  
in_20092013_03   216  
Occurrences of =mi in interrogatives are grammatical, but restricted by epistemic 
considerations (see Section 5.3.3), and the expectation of the speaker regarding the 
state of knowledge and expectation of the addressee (see Section 6.1). The enclitic 
=ta, on the other hand, seems to be epistemically neutral and hence the default – 
although not obligatory – marker associated with focus in content questions. As 
mentioned above, at this stage of research it is not clear  what discourse context s or 
mental states of the speaker are conducive to its occurrence in discourse.  Further 
research should also explore the d iachronic development of the ma rker, and its 
relation to the ACC -ta and the enclitic =tá associated with verum focus.  
 Discourse markers and IS in TK: a summary  4.6
In this chapter, I have discussed syntactic and morphological marking of IS in Tena 
Kichwa. I have shown that syntactic marking of IS in TK is  generally in line with 
cross-linguistically attested patterns , whereby topics tend to occur clause -initially, 
active topics are expressed by pronominal expressions or elided, and only new – or 
contrastive – information receives prosodic prominence (cf. e.g. Krifka 1999; Féry & 
Krifka 2008; Sánchez 2010). The syntactic strategies of IS marking in TK are similar 
to those attested in other Quechua n varieties, but TK is characterised by less strict 
verb-final word order. Both focal and topical constituents can occur post -verbally. 
However, only constituents to the left of the verb can be morphologically marked for 
focus.  
The main aim of this chapte r was to explore the relationship of TK discourse 
enclitics with information structure. In previous analyses of Quechuan, as well as on 
 
301 
 
the basis of a preliminary observation of the TK data, it could be concluded that the 
enclitics in question are morphological markers of IS. In line with cross-linguistically 
attested properties of IS marking, the enclitics appear on the periphery of their host 
constituents (Féry & Krifka 2008: 12). Moreover, while one of the enclitics can only 
occur on presupposed material, the occurrence of others is limited to pragmatically 
asserted content. However, none of the enclitics discussed in this chapter is required 
for marking IS categories, which suggests that ultimately, they cannot be analysed as 
markers of IS. As mentioned previously, other aspects of their semantics need to also 
be considered to determine the exact meanings they encode.  
Presupposed material, including primary, secondary , and frame -setting topics, as 
well as background information, can be marked by the enclitic =ga. Presupposed 
information is not obligatorily marked, but =ga tends to occur on material that the 
speaker wishes to make particularly sa lient. This applies abov e all to the occurrence 
of the enclitic on background constituents. Topical constituents are salient by 
definition, but the fact that =ga occurs most often, but not exclusively, in contrastive 
or switch-topic constructions suggest that more subjective fact ors, which depend less 
on the linguistic context, and more on the psychological states of the speaker, could 
also play a role in the (non -)occurrence of the marker. Which factors are relevant for 
the distribution of =ga and how they influence it, remains t o be determined in future 
research. What does emerge from the discussion in this chapter is that the TK =ga 
should not be analysed simply as a ‘topic marker’, since it is not an obligatory 
marker of topicality in TK.  
While presupposed content can only be marked with =ga, different enclitics can 
occur on the pragmatically asserted portion of the utterance. The enclitic =tá only 
occurs in positive polarity verum focus constructions, and the distribution of =ta is 
limited to narrow focus in content questions.  The enclitic =mi, which is the most 
frequent of all the ‘focus’ markers in the corpus, can occur in both contexts 
mentioned above, as well in information and contrastive focus constructions, which 
are also compatible with =ma and =mari. The enclitic =chu marks both negation and 
focus, and shares many distributional properties with the enclitics =cha and =chari 
(see Section 4.5.4), which  occur on focal constituents in  polar interrogatives and 
rhetorical questions.   
 
302 
 
In this chapter, I have shown that the distribution of the markers listed above cannot 
be explained merely in terms of their association with different cl ause types or focus 
structures. While the markers’ occurrence within the clause is determined by the 
topic-focus a rticulation, and their occurrence is restricted to focal constituents, it 
seems that the marking of IS is secondary to other aspects of their meaning. In 
Chapter 5, I show that most of the focus -associated enclitics discussed above can be 
analysed as encoding meanings related to the origo’s epistemic primacy. I 
demonstrate that taking these meanings into account makes it possible to determine 
the context in which one of the focus -associated enclitics is likely to be chosen over 
the other.  
 
303 
 
 The TK ‘evidential’ enclitics as markers Chapter 5
   of epistemic authority 
In Chapter 4 , I discussed the information structural functions of the TK discourse 
enclitics. Here, I focus on the epistemic semantics of the marke rs, concentrating on 
the enclitics which have been labelled ‘evidential’ in other varieties: =mi and =cha. 
Although the data show that in TK these – and other – discourse enclitics encode 
meanings related to epistemic authority rather than evidentiality, d iscussing the latter 
is necessary to provide context for the epistemic authority analysis presented here. 
Firstly, I briefly discuss the state of the art in the research on evidentiality and related 
categories, including epistemic authority ( 5.1). Secondly, I discuss the previous 
studies of evidential enclitics in Quechuan languages ( 5.2). Following on from that, I 
analyse the epistemic semantics of the TK cognates of evidential markers: =mi and 
=cha (5.3). Finally, I briefly discuss the meaning of the other discourse enclitics 
(5.4). and provide a short summary of the chapter (5.5).  
 Evidentiality and related categories in cross-linguistic 5.1
perspective 
This section discusses the relationship between evidentiality and related categories. 
Firstly, I outline the relationship between evidentiality and related categories ( 5.1.1). 
Secondly, I f ocus on the different dimensions of knowledge to which evidentiality 
has been linked in the literature ( 5.1.2) Lastly, I discuss the semantic distinctions 
postulated within the evidential domain (5.1.3). 
 Evidentiality and related categories 5.1.1
The concept of linguistic marking of the sourc e of information as a semantic and 
grammatical category in its own right originate d from Franz Boas’ descriptive work 
in the early XX th century (cf. Jacobsen 1986; Dendale & Tasmowski 2001; 
Aikhenvald 2004; Gipper 2011; Howard 2012) . However, it was not until the 1980s 
that evidentiality  became a more popular topic of research. The first conference 
themed on the marking of the source of evidence in the world’s languages took place 
 
304 
 
in 1981. The volume of proceedings published five years later (Chafe & Nichols 
1986) sparked the academic interest in evidentiality that has , since then, been on the 
rise. Over the past three decades, the body of descriptive and typological work on the 
topic has grown significantly (see e.g. Willett 1988; Aikhenvald & Dixon 1998; 
Aikhenvald 2004; de Haan 2013 for typological overviews) , and evidentiality has 
been analysed from different theoretical perspectives  (cf. Bruil 2014 : 24). The body 
of both descriptive and theoretical work on the topic is too vast to be granted a 
comprehensive review here. Consequently, I focus on the publications relevant to the 
evidential distinctions found in Quechuan languages, and theoretical perspectives 
related to that adopted in this thesis. This section is concerned mostly with evidential 
semantics, whereas issu es such as syntactic project ions of the evidential phrase (cf. 
e.g. Cinque 1999; Speas 2004; Blain  & Déchaine 2007) are beyond the scope of this 
overview.  
The semantic boundaries of evidentiality have been demarcated in different ways. 
Early analyses defined evidential marking as encoding ‘attitudes toward knowledge’ 
(Chafe & Nichols 1986: vii)  or a ‘range of epistemological considerations’ (Chafe 
1986). Such understanding is tanta mount to t he ‘broad’ approach to  evidentiality: 
regarding it as encoding both the ‘speaker’s attitude towards knowledge’, and the 
‘source of knowledge’42 (Chafe 1986). This broad understanding relies on the axiom 
that people tend to be sure of things for whi ch they have reliable evidence (Chafe & 
Nichols 1986: vii; Weber 1986) . Such a definition implies intrinsic links between 
evidentiality a nd epistemic modality. This link is also present i n the literature on 
modality contemporary to early wor k on evidential systems, where markin g of the 
source of evidence was considered within epistemic modality (Palmer 1986; Willett 
1988). Palmer (1986, cited in Willett 1988: 54) mentions ‘inference’ and ‘confidence’ 
as two relevant epistemic parameters. Lyons (1977: 793) defines epistemic modality 
as ‘concerned with the nature and source of knowledge’, and ‘qualifying the speaker's 
commitment to the truth of the proposition’. The assumption that speakers are most 
committed to the truth of propositions for which they have direct evidence is intuitive, 
and true for most  everyday situations. However, there are cases, such as those of 
religious beliefs or knowledge acquired from authority, where speaker’s commitment 
                                                 
42 Note that in this case ‘knowledge’ can be used interchangeably with ‘information’ or ‘evidence’.  
 
305 
 
and direct evidence do not go hand in hand (cf. De Haan 1998; Faller 2002; Michael 
2008, cf. Section 5.2.2).  
The mismatches between speaker co mmitment to the truth of a proposition and 
access to direct evidence for it underpin s a different tradition of looking at 
evidentiality, whereby the epistemic and the evidential  are regarded as distinct types 
of propositional modality (Palmer 2001) . Under this view, e pistemic modality is 
related to the speake r’s judgements about the factual status of propositions. 
Evidential modality, on the other hand, indicates the evidence speakers have to 
support their statements (Palmer 2001: 8-9). Regarding the source of information on 
which a proposition is based as independent from the speakers’ beliefs about the 
veracity of that proposition yields the ‘narrow’ definition of evidentiality (e.g. Willett 
1988: 54; Nikolaeva 2000; Dendale & Tasmowski 2001:  342-3; Aikhenvald 2004), 
which I adopt in this thesis. According to this approach, evidentiality marks the 
source of  information on which a proposition is based , while epistemic modality 
evaluates the likelihood that this proposition is true (Cornille 2009, cited in Fetzer & 
Oishi 2014) . Nonetheless, the e vidential and modal meaning s are often hard to 
separate (Palmer 2001) , and cross -linguistic evidence shows that evidential and 
epistemic modal meanings can be encoded by the same set of markers  (Willett 1988: 
55).  
Narrowly defined evidentiality and epistemic modality have also been defined as two 
sub-types of the category of ‘epistemicity’ (Boye 2012). Under this view, they both 
provide the ‘justificatory support’ for a proposition. Evidentiality provides the 
‘epistemic justification’, which can be either direct or indirect (cf. Table 5.1) i n 
Section 5.1.3). Epistemic modality provides ‘epistemic support’, which can be ‘full’ 
(certainty), ‘partial’ (probability) or ‘neutral’ (lacking epistemic qualification) (cf. 
Boye 2012:  36). The term ‘epistemic meaning’ is used in this thesis in a broader 
sense than this adopted by Boye (2012: sec. 1.5). After Bergqvist (2015), I see both 
evidentiality and epistemic modality as categories within the ‘epistemic perspective 
domain’(see Section 5.1.2).   
Even studies which define evidentiality narrowly, as a linguistic coding of the source 
of information, acknowledge that evidential marking can be exploited in discourse to 
give rise to a range of pragmatic effects (cf. e.g. Aikhenvald 2004) . Indirect 
 
306 
 
evidential marking encodes the existence of a physical distance between th e event 
and the speaker, unable to access it directly. In many languages, the distance 
introduced by indirect evidentiality can be manipulated in order to achieve pragmatic 
effects related to the epistemic stance. These effects include mitigating responsib ility 
for the information conveyed  (Dickinson 19 99; Aikhenvald 2004; Bruil 2014 ), or 
indicating the degree of speaker’s involvement in the event desc ribed (Bergqvist, 
forthcoming; Jalava & Sandman 2012) . This evo kes a parallel between the use of 
evidential and egophoric (conjunct/disjunct) marking . Non-prototypical use of 
markers in both systems implies speaker’s dissociation from the event described 
(Aikhenvald 2004; Dickin son 2000). This is illustrated with examples below: (5.1) 
shows the unmarked use of the congruent43 marker in Tsafiki, where the speaker was 
acting volitionally  and consciously. It contrasts with (5.1 b), where the action was 
performed unintentionally:  
(5.1)  Tsafiki (Barbacoan, Ecuador) 
a. la   kuchi=ka  tote-yo-e 
 1MASC  pig    =ACC  kill-CNGR-DECL 
         ‘I killed the pig.’ 
b. la   kuchi=ka  tote-i-e 
 1MASC  pig=ACC  kill-NCNGR-DECL 
 ‘I killed the pig (unintentionally).’  
Dickinson (2000: 412) 
The non-congruent marker is (5.1b) indicates the lack of intentionality . It allows the 
speaker to distance himself from the action, despite having carried it out. A similar 
effect can be achieved through the use of indirect evidentiality: 
(5.2) Wintu (Wintuan, Northern California)  
čoyiila -ke ni 
drunk  -REP I 
‘I am drunk (I hear).’/‘They tell me I’m drunk.’ 
Willett (1988: 65) 
                                                 
43 Dickinson (2000) uses the term congruent/non-congruent for the conjunct/disjunct type distinctions. 
She points o ut that the markers not only mark personal reference, but also indicate what is 
congruent/non-congruent with the speaker’s knowledge. More recently, the term ‘egophoricity’ has 
been preferred over ‘conjunct-disjunct’ (e.g. Knuchel 2016; Floyd et al. 2016; Gawne forthcoming). 
 
307 
 
In (5.2), the use of REP+1SUBJ indicates that the speaker was not aware of his state. 
This collocation is used to achieve this pragmatic effect also in other  evidential 
languages, including certain Quechuan varieties (Faller 2002: 190; Aikhenvald 2004: 
ch. 7), but not in TK, where the reportative does not occur. 
In conjunct-disjunct systems , first person  declarative clauses  (5.3a) and second 
person interrogative clauses (5.3b) receive the same (congruent) marker:  
(5.3) Tsafiki (Barbacoan, Ecuador) 
a. sona  muna-ra-yo-e 
         woman  desire:COV-BE.POSITION:GEN-CNGR-DECL 
‘(I) need a woman.’ 
b. ti   muna-ra-yo-n 
what  desire:COV-BE.POSITION:GEN-CNGR-INT 
‘What do you need?’ 
Dickinson (2011: 3) 
Such distribution of the congruent/conjunct marker is related to the ‘interrogative flip’ 
(cf. e.g. Speas & Tenny 2003) , or ‘perceiver shift’ (e.g. Hargreaves 2005 ). In 
declaratives, the ‘epistemic source’ for the proposition is the speaker, whereas in 
interrogative clauses, it is the ad dressee (cf. Hargreaves 2005 ). The congruent 
marking in both ( 5.3a) and (5.3 b) shows that in both cases, the type of ‘epistemic 
source’ is in line with the default epistemic source for a given sentence type.  This 
shows that in egophoric (conjunct/disjunct) marking systems, the markers are not 
always anchored to the speaker. The perceiver shift also occurs in evidential systems 
(cf. e.g. Garrett 2001 ). In the literature on evidentiality, ‘the person from whose 
perspective a given evidential is evaluated’ has been labelled ‘origo’ (Garrett 2001: 
15). In order to apply to other epistemic marking system s, this definition could be 
broadened to designate ‘the person from whose perspective a given expression is 
evaluated’ (e.g. Bühler 1990; Mushin 2001) .44  Evidential expressions establish a 
relationship between the origo and some state of affairs, by specifying the mode of 
                                                 
44 In some literature (e.g. Hargreaves 2005; Bruil 2014) , the label ‘ epistemic authority’ refers to the 
same concept.  In this thesis, I use the term ‘epistemic authority’ as synonymous with ‘epistemic 
primacy’ (cf. Stivers, Mondada & Steensig 2011). I discuss this in more detail in Section 5.1.2. 
 
308 
 
access/type of evidence the origo has for  it. In that sense, evidentiality is a deictic 
category (e.g. Garrett 2001; Mushin 2001; Ifantidou 2001).  
The pragmatic effects arising from the use of indirect evidentials with fi rst person 
marking establish links between evidentiality and another category not discussed 
previously – mirativity. As shown in (5.1b) and (5.2) above, the physical distance 
encoded by indirect evi dentiality can be exploited to give rise to an implicature of 
‘psychological distance’ between the speaker and the event in which she participated 
(cf. e.g. Aksu -Koç & Slobin 1986; Dickinson 1999; 2000; Nikolaeva 2000:sec. 5; 
Merin & Nikolaeva 2008) . While physical distance means that the speaker simpl y 
did not witness the event, ‘psychological distance’ means that ‘ speaker is in some 
way surprised at the event, is not expecting it, and the event happens in some 
uncontrolled way’ (Nikolaeva 2000: sec. 5) . Narrowly defined evidentiality can 
express such distance indirectly, through pragmatic extensions. However, some 
languages encode it by means of mirativity: the ‘linguistic marking of the new and 
unexpected information’ (e.g. Delancey 1997; 2001; Aikhenvald 2004: ch ap. 6).  
Compare (5.1b) above with (5.4) below: 
(5.4) Tsafiki (Barbacoan, Ecuador)  
 la    kuchika  toteinue 
 la   kuchi=ka  tote-i-nu-e 
1MASC  pig=ACC kill-NCNGR-EV/MIR-DECL 
‘I must have killed the pig (unintentionally).’ 
Dickinson (2000: 412) 
The two examples constitute a minimal pair,  only differing in the presence of the 
evidential/mirative marker in (5.4). In both cases, the non-congruent marker signifies 
that the speaker was not aware of the action of killing, despite being its agent. 
Moreover, the use of mirative marker in (5.4) indicates that the proposition expressed 
is unexpected or surprising  to the speaker, who is inferring what happened, rather 
than evoking sensory evidence (Dickinson 2000: 417).  
The pragmatic effects arising from the use of evidentials , including those discussed 
above, were among the issues that sparked interest in analys ing evidential systems 
from pragmatic and discourse perspectives (e.g. Ifantidou 2001; Mushin 2001) . The 
 
309 
 
body of research dedicated to evidentiality in social interaction has increased rapidly 
over the last decade (e.g. Michael 2008; Gipper 2011; Hanks 2012; Nuckolls & 
Michael 2012). A purely semantic account of evidentials was deemed insuffici ent to 
account for how they are used in discourse (cf. Michael 2008: sec.2.4; Gipper 2011: 
10), given that the speaker’s choice of an evidential is no t necessarily motivated by 
the type of evidence she ha s for making a statement  (cf. Mushin 2001 ). It was 
suggested that evidential ma rking can be analysed as a type of stance (cf. Mushin 
2001; Bergqvist 2016) , i.e. ‘the lexical and grammatical expression of attitudes, 
feelings, judgements, or commitment concerning the propositional content of a 
message’ (Biber & Finegan 1989).  
The pragmatic and discourse perspectives on evidentiality led to a number of 
definitions of the category being proposed in order to make its meaning better suited 
for the role it plays in interaction. Faller (2002; 2012)  defines evidentiality a s ‘the 
encoding of the speaker’s grounds for making a speech act, which in the case of 
assertion correspond s to the source of information’. Along similar lines, Michael 
(2008: 137) discusses evidentiality as marking ‘ the nature of speaker’s 
sensory/cognitive access to the event in question’ . The definition of evidentiality in 
terms of ‘mode of access’ rather than ‘source of information’ has been adopted in 
some studies of evidentiality in South American Indigenous languages (cf. Gipper 
2011; Bruil 2014). This definition was argued to be more precise, since it focuses on 
a speaker-particular access to an event, rather than on the event itsel f. In Michael’s 
understanding, one and the same event can be the ‘source of information’ acquired 
by different direct and indirect me ans (Michael 2008: 136-8). In my view, the ‘mode 
of access’ definition only acquires major explanatory power compared with  the 
previous ones if the ‘source of information’ is equated with the event on which the 
speaker comments. However, if we assume, after e.g. Willet (1988) that the source of 
information/ evidence/knowledge is not the event itself, bu t the speaker’s way of 
accessing it, e.g. through the sense s, or  verbal report, the two definitions yield the 
same explanatory power.  
The advantage of th inking of evidentiality in terms of ‘mode of access’ is that this 
definition is more intuitively indexic al, and thus facilitates the deictic interpretation 
of evidential marking as ‘encoding speaker perspective’ towards an event (cf. de 
 
310 
 
Haan 2005; Hanks 2012) . The deictic interpretation of evidentiality emphasises the 
subjectivity and context -dependence of evidential expressions (cf. Floyd 1997; 
Nuckolls 2012). Like other systems of deixis, evidentials cannot be interpreted out of 
context, are ‘egocentric’, and encode subjective ‘speaker reference’ (Levinson 1983: 
ch.2). However, the emphasis solely on speaker perspective was challenged by recent 
research, which shows that the addressee perspective can also play a crucial role in 
defining evidential meanings (see also the discussion of origo above) . This has been 
attested e.g. for Yukararé (Isolate, Bolivia, cf.  Gipper 2011) , Kogi (Chibchan, 
Colombia, cf. Bergqvist, submitted) and South Conchucos Quechua (QI, cf. Daniel J. 
Hintz 2012). Consequently, the descriptions of evidentials can benefit from adopting 
an inter-subjective perspective (cf. e.g. Nuyts 2001; Gipper 2011:10 -12; Hintz & 
Hintz 2014; Bergqvist 2015). Analysing evidentiality and related categories from an 
inter-subjective perspective requires a more detailed discussion of the dimensions of 
knowledge and different participant roles in conversation, provided in Section 5.1.2).  
Additional complexity related to delimiting the boundaries of evidentiality stems 
from the fact that it is not a syntactically or semantically homogenous category . 
Cross-linguistically, marking of the source of information does not operate o n the 
same level of meaning, that is, it does not have a fixed position in the functional 
hierarchy (cf. e.g. Matthewson et al. 2006; Faller 2007: 18) . The literature concerned 
with description of evidentiality  on the syntax -semantics interface distinguishes two 
types of evidential s: ‘modal’ evidentials which contribute to truth conditions are 
distinguished from the ‘non-modal’ ones, which do not (cf. e.g. Faller 2002; Peterson 
2010). The ‘modal’ evidentials make truth-conditional contribution to the meaning of 
utterances, and are analysed as propositional in Gricean pragmatic terms. The ‘non -
modal’ evidentials do not contribute to trut h-conditions, and therefore have most 
frequently been analysed as illocutionary operators (cf. e.g. Faller 2002:110 -19; 
Peterson 2010: chap. 3). The Gricean propositional/illocutionary distinction parallels 
the relevance-theoretical division between propositional and procedural meaning (cf. 
Ifantidou 2001: chap. 7) . However, it has also been suggested that the non -truth 
conditional evidentials be analysed not as illocut ionary, but as clause -type modifiers 
(cf. Portner 2006). I discuss this proposal with rega rd to the TK ‘evidential’ markers 
in Section 5.3.

 Epistemic meaning and the dimensions of knowledge 5.1.2
Epistemic modal, evidential, conjunct -disjunct/egophoric, or mirative marking 
systems discussed above encode different, but re lated aspects of the origo’s 
relationship to the information conveyed by an utterance. Nonetheless, accurate 
semantic description of the TK ‘evidential’ enclitics requires exploring the origo -
information relationship beyond these categories. To this end, I consider evidentiality 
and related categories in relation to the dimensions of knowledge in interaction (cf. 
Stivers et al. 2011: 13), presented in Figure 5.1.  
Figure 5.1 Dimensions of knowledge 
i. Epistemic access  (knowing vs. not knowing/ types of evidence/     
                                           degree of certainty) 
ii. Epistemic primacy           (relative right to know/claim, authority of 
   knowledge) 
iii. Epistemic responsibility  (obligations/rights to have information) 
The three dimensions listed in  Figure 5.1 correspond to the different ‘levels’ on 
which knowledge can be grounded in conversation. Evidentiality clearly falls within 
the dimension of ‘epistemic access’, since it is relates to the origo’s types of evidence 
for the proposition conveyed. E pistemic modality also falls within that domain, as 
related to the origo’s degree of certainty.  
The domain of epistemic primacy is more subjective than epistemic access . While 
epistemic access is concerned with the relationship between the proposition and  the 
origo, epistemic primacy has to do with the distribution of knowledge between 
participants of the speech event. Epistemic primacy is the asymmetry ‘ in the depth, 
specificity or completeness of their [speech act participants] knowledge’ (Stivers et 
al. 2011b: 13) . Consequently, making of ‘epistemic primacy’ is grounded in the 
subjective assessment of the origo’s knowledge state rather than in the relationship of 
that knowledge to the world. While epistemic primacy often arises as a result of 
having the best possible t ype of evidence for the information in question, or being 
certain that the proposition is true, it needs not be grounded in those parameters.  
Nonetheless, epistemic authority is independent from the speaker’s evaluation of the 
 
312 
 
factuality of the proposition  and, consequently, independent from the marking of 
epistemic modality.  
Egophoric marking could be seen as operating on this level, since conjunct marking 
is compatible only with origo which has ‘epistemic privilege’ (Dickinson 2016), that 
is, in situations where the origo is also a primary actor in the situation, and hence has 
privileged access to the information about it. In Section  5.3, I show that the TK 
‘evidential’ markers are also grounded in the domain of epistemic primacy, rather 
than epistemic access. In the remainder of this thesis, I use the term ‘epistemic 
authority’ as synonymous with epistemic primacy as defined above.45  
The third domain – epistemic responsibility – is related to the information t hat the 
speaker has an obligation or a right to know . For instance, it is expected of everyone 
to know their own name etc.  On the other hand, there is information about other 
people, their internal states and experiences,  or private affairs,  about which their 
interlocutors do not have a responsibility, or even a right, to possess knowledge. This 
last domain is akin to Kamio’s (1997) ‘Territory of Information’  (henceforth ToI) .  
The types of information which fall within one’s default ToI are (i) internal di rect 
experience, (ii) information within one’s professional expertise, (iii) information 
obtained through external direct experience including verbal reports, and considered 
reliable, (iv) information about persons, object, events and facts in one’s close 
environment, (v) information about oneself (Kamio 1997: 18). In terms of domains 
of knowledge introduced above, one h as right to all the information listed above, but 
also a responsibi lity to be familiar with them. Other types of information can also 
become part of one’s ToI when they become integrated into one’s system of 
knowledge and beliefs, or, as Kamio (1997:11-2) puts it, when they are ‘digested and 
absorbed’. He claims that the pace of abso rbing might depend on the type of 
information – more personal information tends to be absorbed sooner. Faller (2002) 
describes a similar process as relevant to the integration of information into the Best 
Possible Ground in Cuzco Quechua (see Section 5.2).  
Although this has not been mentioned by the authors (cf. Stivers et al. 2011) , t he 
domains of epistemic primacy and epistemic responsibility correlate with one 
                                                 
45 In some previous literature (e.g. Hargreaves 2005), ‘epistemic authority’ was used in the same sense 
in which I use the term ‘origo’ here.

another. It should be expected that the speaker has epistemic primacy over the 
information she also has an obligation, or right, to know.   
The dimensions of knowledge discussed above relate mainly to the origo, and to the 
extent to which she can know , or claim to know , a piece of information . The only 
reference to the interpersonal aspect of context i n the taxonomy i n Figure 5.1 is the 
observation that epistemic primacy is ‘a relative right to know or claim’. The relative 
nature of epistemic primacy suggests that the origo’s interlocutor and his state of 
knowledge should also be taken into account . In line with this  observation is the 
approach taken by Bergqvist (2015), who proposes to analyse evidentiality and other  
epistemic marking systems within the domain of ‘epistemic perspective’, 
encompassing not only the relationship of origo to information/knowledge, but also 
distribution of knowledge between the speech act participants. He uses the concept of 
‘functional do main’ coined by Givón (1981) as a tool to compare and relate 
individual functions of linguistic items. A domain is a larger conceptual structure 
which can encompass several functions. Givón prefers ‘functional domains’ to 
‘functions’, since the latter are often not totally discreet. The ‘functi onal domains’ 
are larger conceptual structures, and can overlap with one another, or encompass 
several levels of meaning (Bergqvist 2015:  11). Proposing the existence of the 
functional domain of ‘epistemic perspective’ is based on two assumptions. The first 
assumption that evidentiality and  related systems share a ‘functional space’ in the 
grammar of languages in which they occur. The second assumption is that these 
epistemic marking systems allow the speaker to adopt different ‘perspectives’ with 
respect to both information/knowledge, and their interlocutors (Bergqvist 2015: 11). 
Before discussing epistemic perspective in more detail, it is necessary to introduce 
two notions at the core of the semantic and functional distinctions postulated by 
Bergqvist (2015): subjectivity and intersubjectivity. Subjectivity can be defined as  
(…) the way in which natural languages, in their structure and their 
normal manner of operation, provide for the locutionary agent’s 
expression of himself and his own attitudes and beliefs. 
Lyons (1982: 102) 
Understood in this manner, subjective expressions index the attitudes or viewpoint of 
the speaker /origo. A further evaluative dimension is introduced by distinguishing 
 
314 
 
subjective expression from intersubjective ones (cf. Traugott & Dasher 2002) . 
Intersubjective expressions are related to the speakers’ ‘acknowledgement of and 
attention to the addressee’ (Traugott 2010:  2). Consequently, intersubjective 
expressions take into account the attitudes of, or distribution of knowledge between, 
the speaker and the addressee.  
The domain of epistemic perspective (Bergqvist 2015 ), encompassing the different 
categories of epistemic meaning, can be divided into different subdomains depending 
on the (inter)subjectivity of the  meanings they express.  Figure 5.2 shows this 
stratification:

Bergqvist (2015: 12) 
As mentioned above, the notion of ‘ epistemic perspective’ points to the fact that all 
the categories shown in  Figure 5.2 are to some extent concerned with marking the 
(a)symmetries in access to information between the participants of discourse. From 
bottom to top, the different epistemic marking systems, shown on the right-hand side, 
are organised from the least to the most intersubjective. On the left -hand side, Figure 
5.2 shows the different ‘functional domain s’ corresponding the epistemic marking 
systems shown on the right. The arrow corresponds to the levels of meaning, based 
on the assumptions that the categories at the bottom of the scale encode more 
propositional meaning, and hence have narrower scope, and the categories towards 
the top encode non-propositional meaning. The marking of ‘complex epistemic 
perspective’ refers to the fully intersubjective systems, in the encoding of which the 
perspectives of both participants of the interaction are equally important . Figure 5.2 
 
315 
 
is based on a preliminary cross -linguistic survey, including the grammatical 
categories attested in  a sample of languages with epistemic marking systems 
(Bergqvist 2015 ). The number of functional domains – and corresponding 
grammaticalised marking systems – is bound to increase if other languages are taken 
into account. Examples of such systems could include the marking of engagement (cf. 
e.g. Landaburu 2007) or ‘information status’ of discourse participants (cf. San Roque 
2008).  
Cross-linguistically, much further research  is needed  to establish whether the 
dimensions of knowledge presented  in Figure 5.1 are grammatically marked, and 
how they can be incorporated into the ‘epistemic perspective  domain’ shown in  
Figure 5.2. However, for individual languages, some of the relevant information is 
already available.  In Japanese, ‘epistemic primacy’ is encoded by dedicated 
morphology, namely the marker yo (Hayano 2011) . In Section 5.3, I show that 
epistemic primacy is also morphologically marked in  TK, where the distribution of 
epistemic authority between speaker and addressee is  encoded by =mi and =cha. 
Therefore, at least for certain languages, including T K, epistemic primacy should be 
considered one of t he ‘functional domains’ of epistemic perspective. I come back to 
this proposal in Section 6.4.  
 Semantic distinctions within the evidential domain 5.1.3
This section describes the semantic distinctions which have been postulated with in 
the domain of evidentiality, defined as the linguistic marking of the ‘source of 
evidence’ for a proposition.  
In his influential cross -linguistic survey of evidential systems, Willett  (1988) 
examined data from 38 languages with grammaticalised evidentiality. On the basis of 
that data, he proposed the taxonomy of sources of evidence presented be low in Table 
5.1. Aikhenvald (2004) distinguished the same types of sources of evidence in her 
broader cross-linguistic survey of over 500 languages.

Reasoning  (conjecture) 
Adapted from Willett (1988); Aikhenvald (2004) 
Of the distinctions presented above, the least intuitive one is that between inference  
and conjecture. In Willett’s (1988: 96) terms, inference from results occurs when the 
speaker perceives observable results of an event/action. Conjecture occurs when ‘the 
speaker infers the situation described on the basis of intuition, logic, a dream, 
previous experience, or some other mental construct’. 
The taxonomy presented in  Table 5.1 was envisaged as a model for the possi ble 
types of evidential distinction made cross -linguistically, extrapolating from those 
found in the languages of the sample. The prediction this particular taxonomy makes 
about the possible evidential systems is that one marker cannot be used to code type s 
of evidence that belong to different overarching types. That means that while we can 
expect a marker that would encompass inference and reportative evidence, the 
taxonomy does not predict a marker that would encode both non -visual sensory and 
reportative evidence. Nonetheless, Plungian (2001) observed that in some evidential 
systems, the main distinction is made not between direct and indir ect, but between 
reported and non -reported evidence. This led him to postulate that the ‘degree of 
                                                 
46 Willett (1988) is not clear about the distinction between Direct and Attested. Faller (2002: 48) 
remarks that distinguishing bet ween the two might have to do with language -specific terminological 
differences, which, however, does not suffice to postulate two different categories of evidence. Hence 
the conflation of Direct and Attested in Table 5.1. 
 
317 
 
personal involvement’ 47  should be considered as an organising parameter of 
evidential systems (Plungian 2001; cf. Faller 2002: 49-50). This proposal is in line 
with more recent pragmatic/interactional studies of evidential systems (see Section  
5.1.1).     
Faller (2002: sec. 2.3) follows up on Plungian’s proposal and re-organises the 
evidential taxonomy so as to better reflect the problemati c data. She proposes that 
direct evidence and evidence based on reasoning are not entirely distinct, and that we 
should instead think of personal evidence  ‘as a cline of increasing amounts of 
reasoning from evidence ’ (Faller 2002: 50). The evidential distinctions  proposed by 
Faller have proven  effective for the  description of the evidential system of Cuzco 
Quechua (cf. Faller 2002) , and are also partially relevant to the description of the 
evidential system of Tena Kichwa (see Section 5.3).  
Following de Haan’s (1998) scalar ordering of evidential types  for individual 
languages, Faller (2002) proposes that the cross -linguistic taxonomy of evidence  
types can be regarded as a scale. Typically, linguistic scales give rise  to implicatures 
as a result of  entailment relation of degree of informativeness (Faller 2002: 72) . 
Faller suggests that for evidential scales, implicatures are triggered by the ‘degrees of 
strength of evidence’ (2002:73). She also argues that, unlike other linguistic scales, 
the evidential scale cannot be thought of as linear if it is to be cross -linguistically 
applicable (see Faller 2002: 62 -70 for discussion) . She bases her conclusion on the 
fact that  the ordering of inferential and reportative evidence with respect to one 
another seems to pattern differently in language-specific evidential systems.  
Faller suggests that the types of evidence should be ordered on two separate clines, 
based on two types of directness: one measured by ‘the amount of inference involved 
in reaching the conclusion’, and the other, by the number of intervening speakers: 
 
 
 
                                                 
47 Involvement was also judged as relevant to marking of egophoricity and mirativity  (Hargreaves 
2005; Creissels 2008; Knuchel 2016), discussed in Section 5.1.1) 
 
318 
 
Figure 5.3 Evidence clines 
a. The Personal Evidence Cline:

reasoning > assumption 
b. The Mediated Evidence Cline: 
direct > (learning) > secondhand > thirdhand > hearsay/folklore 
Adapted from Faller (2002: 70) 
The ordering relation in both clines is based on directness. For personal evidence, the 
directness is defined as an amount of reasoning involved in arriving at the conclusion. 
For mediated evidence, directness is defined in terms of the number of intervening 
speakers (if ‘learning’ is excluded, see below). Implicatures arise within each cline 
separately, and Faller postulates that the two clines should ultimately be joined 
together, but it is not clear where the linking should occur.  
In the Mediated Evidence Cline, the category of ‘learning’ is included in parenthesis.  
This is due to the fact that if we include ‘learning’ as an evidential type (cf. Givón 
1982), it can no longer be based on the number of ‘intervening’ speakers. However, 
in a number of languages, including Cuzco Quechua, the direct evidential can also be 
used to mark knowledge acquired through learning . So the cline including learning 
does make a correct prediction. Further research is needed to consistently account for 
such ordering of mediated evidence (Faller 2002: 53) . However, it seems that 
learning is more easily included  in the category of m ediated evidence i f we think 
about it, not in terms of numbers of intervening sources, but in terms of how well the 
information is integrated into the speaker’s worldview (cf. e.g. Givón 1982).  
 Evidentiality in Quechuan languages 5.2
This section presents the current scholarship on Quechua evidentiality and examine s 
the extent to which the findings reported for other varieties can be applied to the 
‘evidential’ markers in Tena Kichwa.  Firstly, I discuss the linguistic expressions of 
evidentiality in the different Quechuan dialects ( 5.2.1). Subsequently, I focus on the 
 
319 
 
previous analyses of the semantics and pragmatic s of direct and indirect evidentiality 
in the Quechuan varieties described to date (5.2.2).48  
 The Quechuan evidential paradigm 5.2.1
Most of the described Quechuan varieties make a three -way evidential distinction 
between direct, conjectural/inferential and reported source of information. Prior to 
the evidential analyses, the markers in question were interp reted e.g. as ‘comment of 
clause’ (Parker 1969) or ‘validational’: indicating the speaker’s epistemic judgement 
(Adelaar 1977; Cole 1982; Lefebvre & Muysken 1988).  
Since Weber’s (1986) study of the enclitics’ function in Huánuco Quechua (QI), they 
have predominantly been analysed as evidential markers (e.g. Weber 1986; Floyd 
1997; Faller 2002; Hintz 2012; Howard 2012) . However, previous analyses were not 
entirely dismissed. Across the varieties, Quechua ‘evidential’ markers do not fit in 
with the ‘narrow’ definition of evidentiality as only marking the source of 
information. The Quechuan evidential markers were interpreted as indicating the 
speaker’s source of  information as well as: epistemic judgement (e.g. Weber 1986; 
Nuckolls 1993; Floyd 1997; Adelaar 1997) , illocutionary force (Faller 2002; 
Nuckolls 2012), speaker subjectivity (Howard 2012; Nuckolls 201 2), or distinction 
between individual and shared knowledge  (D.J. Hintz 2012; Howard 2012) . In some 
varieties, certain markers were analysed as purely evidential, while other were 
considered to be more validational in nature (e.g. Adelaar 1977; Faller 2002).  
Most Quechuan varieties exhibit a three -way distinction between direct, 
conjectural/inferential and reported evidence. The parad igm is illustrated with  
examples from Cuzco Quechua in Figure 5.4 below:  
 
 
 
                                                 
48 Since the reportative marker does not occur in TK (see Section 5.2.1), it is only discussed when 
relevant to the analyses of the direct and indirect enclitics.

Adapted from Faller (2002: 122) 
The enclitic =mi was analysed by Faller (2002) as the marker of ‘best possible 
ground’. It corresponds to direct evidence if the information in question belongs to 
the speaker’s own life experience. However, in case of encyclopaedic knowledge, 
which tends to be learnt from authority rather than through direct experience, the 
‘best possible ground’ can correspond to reportative evidence (see Section  5.2.2.1). 
Authors describing other Quechuan varieties report a range of cognates of the 
markers listed above (cf. e.g. Nuckolls 1993: 228; Manley 2015: sec. 5).  
Although most described Quechuan languages have a tripartite evidential distinction, 
recent studies show that the number of evidential markers varies across dialect s. 
South Conchucos Quechua (QI) is reported to have five evidential markers (Daniel J. 
Hintz 2012; Hintz & Hintz 2014) . Six markers have been described for Sihuas 
Quechua (QI)  (Diane Hintz 2012; Hintz & Hintz 201 4), and Huamalíes Quechua 
(Howard 2012) , both closely related to South Conchucos. In these varieties, the 
speaker’s choice of evidential is influenced not only by the type of evidence, but also 
by the distribution of knowledge be tween discourse participants (see Section  6.3). 
All these systems have the direct, indirect and reportative markers. In addition, South 
Concuchos has markers asserting mutual knowledge and indicating shared conjecture 
 
321 
 
(Hintz & Hintz 2014 ). Sihuas has a system of three contrastive pairs, indicating the 
distinctions between individual and mutual knowledge, individual and shared 
conjecture and individual knowledge from report vs generalised knowledge from 
reported information (Hintz & Hintz 2014) . In Huamalíes, the non-standard markers 
indicate speculation, affirmation of knowledge co-constructed by the speaker and the 
addressee and negation of such knowledge 49 (Howard 2012). In the above systems, 
the markers do not correspond strictly to source of information – the use of 
‘individual’ vs ‘shared’ knowledge markers is also influenced by the speaker’s 
opinion about w hether she has epistemic authority over the information conveyed 
(Hintz & Hintz 2014 : 8). Epistemic authority in particular is relevant to the 
description of the ‘evidential’ markers in TK (see Section 5.3). 
In all the varieties discussed abov e, the evidentia l paradigm consisted of three or  
more markers. However, in some varieties, including Imbabura Quechua (QII) (Cole 
1982: 164 -5), spoken in the Ecuadorian Highlands, and  in TK, reports are marked 
periphrastically by means of the verb ni- (‘say’) rather than by the use of a dedicated 
marker. Interestingly, the reportative marker is attested in the Pastaza Quichua (QII) 
(Nuckolls 1993; 2012) , which is related to TK  more closely  than the highland 
Imbabura variety. Cole (1982: 165) observes that while the marker -shi is attested in 
Imbabura, it seems to have undergone sem antic shift from marking hearsay to 
marking speculation.  
In the TK data, the reportative marker seems to have been replaced by a periphrastic 
construction, whereby the verb of speech ni- (‘say’) is used in all hearsay/reportative 
contexts as a marker of r eported speech, and the speech complements are often 
marked by the enclitic =mi. I discuss the reportative constructions  of this type  in 
Section 5.3.3.4.  
 Previous analyses of Quechua evidential semantics 5.2.2
In Section 5.2.1, I introduced the evidential paradigms postulated for  different 
Quechuan varieties. Here, I discuss the semantics of the direct ( 5.2.2.1) and indirect 
                                                 
49 In Howard’s (2012) terms, co -constructed knowledge results from the exchange of information 
between the speaker and the  addressee. This is different from Hintz and Hintz’s (2014) ‘shared 
knowledge’, understood as knowledge shared by participants, acquired either via linguistic exchange, 
or shared non -linguistic experience. The latter understanding is more in line with widely accepted  
definitions of common ground (see Section 4.1.1).

(5.2.2.2) markers. In order to contextualise this discussion, I first briefly introduce 
the theoretical and analytical perspectives a dopted in the previous studies of 
Quechuan evidentiality.  
Weber (1986) presented the first descripti ve account of the Quechuan evidential 
paradigm, using data from central Peruvian varieties, mainly Huánuco Quechua (QI). 
He considered the markers to be primarily evidential, with their epistemic readings 
stemming from Quechuan cultural axioms (see  Section 5.2.2.1). Floyd (1997) 
examined Wanka Q uechua (QI) evidential semantics from the cognitive linguistics  
point of view, seeing each evidentia l as a ‘radial category’ , encoding one central  
meaning, but also used to co nvey other meanings that ‘are not strictly predictable 
from the central case but are cultural products’ (Evans & Green 2006: 276) . In 
Floyd’s (1997) interpretation, the evidence -marking meaning of Quechua evidential 
enclitics arises from primarily epistemic schema, having to do with certainty (see 
Section 5.2.1) and attenuation (see Section  5.2.2.2). A similar analysis of the 
evidential paradigm comes from the tradition of linguistic anthropology (Nuckolls 
1993; 2012; Howard 2012) . Both Nuckolls (1993; 2012) and Howard (2012) argue 
for revisiting the evidential analysis in favour of an assertive/speaker subjectivity 
interpretation of the paradigm.  
Faller (2002) takes a formal semantics/pr agmatics approach to the analysi s of the 
Cuzco Quechua  evidentials. According to her interpretation, evidentials are 
illocutionary modifiers, and, with the exception of the infe rential/conjectural, do not 
contribute to the at -issue content of utterances. In line with Floyd’s (1997: 8 2) 
observations, she claims that evidentially unmarked utterances implicate  that the 
speaker has sufficient evidence to  use a direct evidential, but the statement made 
without one are slightly weak er than those marked by the direct =mi (Faller 2002: 
23-4)50.  
As mentioned in Section 5.2.1, the reportative marker which could be analysed as a 
cognate of the Cuzco Quechua -si does not occur in the TK data. However, it is 
prudent to  briefly mention how the reportative has been analysed in the varieties 
                                                 
50 This contrasts to some extent with the findings presented by  Manley (2015:172). She asked Cuzco 
Quechua native speaker to evaluate 6 sentences with respect to the degree of certainty of the speaker, 
and the one containing only the PST tense -rqa was evaluated as conveying higher certainty than the 
one with -rqa and =mi.  
 
323 
 
where it does occur. According to all i ts descriptions, the reportative/hearsay marker 
serves to indicate all types of reported information (e.g. Weber 1986; Floyd 1997; 
Faller 2002). Weber (1986) and Floyd (1997) both claim that the reportative is of a 
distinct semantic nature than the direct and indirect evidentials. In their interpretation, 
reports, being detached from speaker responsibility, do not express a 
validational/epistemic meaning encoded by the direct and indirect markers ( see 
Sections 5.2.2.1 and 5.2.2.2). Faller analyses the reportative as an illocutionary force 
modifier, changing the force of an utterance from asserting a proposition, to 
presenting a proposition uttered by someone else  (cf. Faller 2002: 188 -204). Under 
this analysis, the C uzco Quechua reportative is ‘modally neutral’, that is, it does not 
encode the speaker’s judgement about whether the pre sented proposition is a 
possibility (Faller 2002: 23). Bruil (2014: 45-9) claims that the CQ reportative should 
be analysed as modifying the sentential force of a clause, rather than the illocutionary 
force of an utterance. The adequacy of this proposal for the description of TK 
‘evidential’ enclitics is considered in more detail in Section 5.3.5.  
5.2.2.1 Previous analyses: =mi 
The ‘direct’ enclitic =mi has been described as the  semantically most complex 
member of the Quechuan evidential paradigm. Various analyses point out that its 
meaning is related to direct evidence and/or the epistemic stance certainty, but vary 
with respect to which of these meanings are encoded, and which are merely indicated 
by the marker (cf. Parker 1969; Adelaar 1977; Weber 1986; Adelaar 1997; Floyd 
1997; Faller 2002). 
Weber (1986) analyses =mi as encoding the evidential meaning of ‘learn t by direct 
experience’. He claims that =mi can give rise to the i mplicature of certainty due to 
the Quechua cultural axiom according to which ‘(only) one’s own experience is 
reliable’ (Weber 1986: 1 38). Faller (2002: ch. 4)  points out that although such an 
axiom is intuitively correct, there are situation s which call it into question, such as 
mistaken perceptions etc. She points out that =mi is often used to mark propositions 
which could not have been directly experienced by the speakers, such as future 
events, or internal states of others. Such usage is a lso possible in TK, as 
demonstrated in (5.5a) and (5.5b) below. Example (5.5c) is of another context where 
the use of =mi is pervasive despite the lack of direct experie nce, namely, in case of 
 
324 
 
(religious) beliefs . Such beliefs are not b ased on any kind of experience and are 
conveyed by hearsay, but always expressed in =mi-marked statements.  
(5.5)

 el_18092014_01 025 
The issues related to reliability of direct experience  have been discussed at length by 
Faller (2002), and I relate to them below. The examples in (5.5) show that Weber’s 
analysis of =mi as always encoding direct experien ce cannot be upheld. I also find 
the assumption that the epistemic reading should arise from ‘cultural axioms’ 
particular to the Quechua culture deeply problematic. It is not clear on what gr ounds 
Weber (1986) postulates those cult ure-specific norms of behaviour, since  the only 
source he mentions is the content of folktales.  
Weber regards the validational meaning of =mi as secondary to the evidential one. 
Nuckolls (1993) takes a different view, analysing the marker’s meaning  as primarily 
assertive, with the secondary  direct evidence meaning arising from it in certain 
contexts. However, this fails to account for  the occurrence of =mi in interrogative 
clauses in TK:  
 
325 
 
(5.6) = (4.79) 
Ima  shuti=mi ? 
what name=mi  
‘What is her name?’ [to someone who knows the person in question] 
in_20092013_03 216 
Another argument presented by Nuckolls  in favour of the  assertive analysis is that 
=mi occurs in paradigmatic contras t with the Q/NEG particle =chu. As I show in  
Chapter 4 , the distributions of the two markers is better explained in terms of the 
focus function of =mi than its assertive meaning. N ot every yes/no question marked 
with =chu is answered with a =mi-marked clause, nor are answers to yes/no 
questions the only context in which =mi occurs.  In more recent work, Nu ckolls 
(2012; cf. also Howard 2012) also discusses the deictic meaning of  =mi  as a marker 
of speaker subjectivity, distinguishing the speaker’s assertion from  somebody else’s. 
She bases this analyses on the contrast between =mi and the reportative =shi, which, 
as discussed above, does not occur in TK.  
Floyd’s (1997) account of the meaning of =mi is similar to Nuckolls’ in that he sees 
the direct-evidence marking as but one of the instantiations of a wider meaning of the 
marker. Under his  prototype-theoretical analysi s, the most abstract, schematic 
meaning of =mi is certainty. It plays a role in all its uses, including the most common, 
prototypical one: marking of direct evidence. Floyd sees that prototypical meaning of 
=mi as derived from the fact that certainty is most often based on direct evidence.  
Nonetheless, he also shows that =mi can encode speaker certainty in the absence of 
such evidence (1997: 68-85), as shown in (5.7):  
(5.7) Wanka Quechua (QI)   
a. chay-pii   -mi   papaa-nii-si   chraki   palta-n   nana-y-ta

c. kiija-ka-mu-shraa-mi  ka-n-si 
sue-REF-AFAR51-1FUT-mi be-3-even 
‘I’ll sue.’ 
Floyd (1997: 69-76) 
Floyd explains examples in (5.7) by invoking a variety of ‘mitigating circumstances’ 
to account for speaker certainty in the ab sence of direct evidence.  He claims that   
(5.7a) can be explained by ‘psychological proximity’ between the speaker and the 
subject of their utterance (cf. Aksu-Koç & Slobin 1986) . The speaker is recounting 
an event that happened before she was born , and =mi indicates that she considers the 
story a ‘valid and true’ reason for her f ather’s currently observable condition (Floyd 
1997: 70). According to Floyd, in case of (5.7b) the speaker is the alleged father of a 
baby that has not yet been born, and therefore cannot  have direct evidence for the 
child not being his. Floyd interprets this use of =mi as showing the speaker’s 
willingness to convey certai nty, so as to increase the argumentative force of his 
utterance. In  (5.7c), certainty is derived from the fact that the speaker assume s to 
have control over his future actions , and intends to perform the action he describes . 
The direct marker occurs in contexts shown in (5.7) across Quechuan varieties, 
including Tena Kichwa. Faller (2002) accounts for these in a more uniform manner 
with the concept of ‘best possible ground’, which I discuss below.  
Faller (2002) points out another problem with the analyses proposed by Nuckolls 
(1993) and Floyd (1997). She remarks that if the most general meaning of =mi is that 
of assertiveness (cf. Nuckolls 1993)  or certainty (cf. Floyd 1997) , it should be 
possible to ‘impose’ this general meaning on the situation irrespective of the 
speaker’s source of evidence. This, however, is possible in case s such as those in 
(5.7), but not in (5.8), where the speaker need s to obtain the information from Inés 
herself. This observation also holds for TK.  
 
                                                 
51 Floyd (1997) glosses -mu  as meaning ‘afar’ or ‘far’ – cognate of TK cislocative suffix.

‘Inés is sad.’ [Inés told speaker that she is sad] 
Faller (2002: 127) 
Faller explains the felicitous use of =mi in (5.7) and (5.8) by extending the notion of 
direct evidence to what she calls ‘best possible ground’ (henceforth BPG) for making 
an assertion  (2002: sec. 4.3) . She accurately remarks that there is a fundamental 
difference between ‘personal’ and ‘encyclopedic’ information 52, as mentioned in the 
discussion of evi dence clines in Section 5.1.3. Personal knowledge , related to a 
person’s life and their immediate environment, is acquired through direct experience, 
but can also be divided into observable and not observable events, the latter  
including e.g. emotional states of others etc. (Faller 2002: 132). Consequently, given 
the possible access modes are different, the best poss ible source of information 
differs for those two types of events. If events are not observable for the speaker, as 
in (5.8), what counts as best possible source of information is a report of a person 
who was somehow involved in  the event. This explains why =mi in (5.8) is 
infelicitous unless the information was obtained from Inés herself. The acquisition of 
‘encyclopedic’ information, on the other hand, does not require direct evidence, since 
that sort of knowledge is mostly acquired by learning.  
It follows from the above discussion that directness of the source of information is a 
gradable property of events (Faller 2002: 131) and that the evidential value of =mi is 
broader than just encompassing direct evidence. For personal knowledge, the BPG is 
direct evidence, but for encyclopedic knowledge, it does not have to be (Faller 2002: 
135). Under Faller’s view, having the best possible source of information is a 
necessary, but not sufficient  condition to make a =mi-marked statement. In order to 
felicitously use =mi, the speaker needs to have the BPG for making a statement. 
Apart from having the best possible source of information,  this also means  having 
assimilated the proposition into one’s network of beliefs (Faller 2002: 140 -1). In 
                                                 
52 Note that Faller does not equate ‘encyclop aedic information’ with ‘a priori synthetic knowledge’ as 
defined by Givón (1982). Unlike the a  priori synthetic knowledge, encyclopaedic knowledge is 
challengeable and is not necessarily common ground within a culture or even among the participants 
of a speech event (cf. Faller 2002: 54, 134).  
 
328 
 
Section 5.3.3.2, I show that the fact  of having assimilated the knowledge is of 
particular importance in the analysis of =mi in TK.   
Faller analyses =mi as a non -truth conditional BPG evidential (2002: 154-5). She 
claims that the high degree of certainty associated with =mi arises because of the 
properties of assertive utterances, which require the speaker to believe in the 
proposition expressed, and not because of the semantics of =mi. She chooses to 
analyse the CQ evidentials within the framework of  Gricean pragmatics, which non-
truth conditional elements like =mi can operate (cf. Portner 2006) , and leads her to 
conclude that =mi should be analysed as an illocutionary operator that adds a 
sincerity condition  to the utterances it modifies  (Faller 2002:  157). The sincerity 
condition added by =mi requires that as well as believing the asserted proposition 
(property of assertions in general), the spe aker also has the BPG for believing it.  
According to Faller, this change in sincerity conditions is perceived by the addressee 
as making the utterance stronger, and =mi is often used in situations where the 
speaker reacts to, or anticipates, a challenge from his interlocutor. 
In order to utter an evidentially unmarked assertion, the speaker needs to believe that 
the proposition expressed is true (cf. Chierchia & McConnell -Ginet 1990; Portner 
2004; Portner 2009) . Faller claims that unmarked assertion implicate s that the 
speaker has the BPG for making a statement, but that only =mi-marked assertions  
encode BPG, which is a part of the lexical meaning of =mi. Under this analysis of 
=mi, examples in  (5.5a), (5.5b) and (5.7) can be accounted for without the need of 
invoking cultural axioms (cf. Weber 1986), or assertive meaning (cf. Nuckolls 1993). 
Example (5.5c), wher e =mi occurs on the statement of religious belief, can be 
explained by the irrelevance of evidence to religious belief (Faller 2002: 132). 
According to Faller (2002: sec.6.3.2) , t he use of =mi in content questions, 
exemplified in (5.6) above, can be explained in two ways: =mi can be ‘anchored to 
the speaker’, or ‘anchored to the hearer’ (cf. Aikhenvald 2004: 242-48). In Section 
5.3.3.3, I show that in TK interrogatives =mi also undergoes perceiver shift. 
To sum up, Faller’s analysis of the direct evidential as encoding the BPG 
convincingly does away with additional assumptio ns needed to account for its usage 
in cases where speakers lack direct sensory evidence. However, as she herself admits,  
 
329 
 
the analysis of the marker as an illocutionary modifier of sincerity conditions fails to 
account for the distributional restrictions of  =mi, namely the impossibility of 
occurrence in imperative clauses , since a modifier of sincerity conditions should be 
able to occur in all types of speech acts . Faller claims that =mi-marked assertions 
are perceived emphatically because of their greater illocutionary strength. In this case, 
it is also  unclear how to account for  =mari, which she analyses as the ‘emphatic’ 
version of the direct marker.  
Another analysis of =mi which is relevant to the description of the TK =mi is the 
description of the mark er in Souch Conchucos Quechua (henceforth SCQ). SCQ has 
a five -value evidential system, making a distinction between individual or shared 
direct evidence, and individual or shared conjecture (Hintz & Hintz 2014 ). Since the 
SCQ -mi only marks individual direct knowledge, it does not communi cate general 
knowledge, as in CQ, but rather is used to ‘specify the exclusion of the perspective of 
the addressee and confer expert status on the speaker’ (Hintz & Hintz 2014: 15). This 
analysis shows that the semantics of the SCQ -mi is very similar to the epistemic 
primacy analyses of the TK =mi proposed in this thesis.  
5.2.2.2 Previous analyses: =cha 
The ‘inferential/conjectural evidential ’ enclitic =cha has been  analysed as 
‘conjectural’ (Weber 1986; Faller 2002) , ‘inferential’ (Floyd 1997)  or ‘dubitative’ 
(Muysken 1995) in the different Quechuan varieties . Despite the different labels, in 
all the varieties for which it has been described, t he marker is report ed to cover 
indirect evidence based both on reasoning and conjecture (see Section  5.1.3), as 
shown in the Cuzco Quechua examples below:  
(5.9) Inference (from observable facts)

he was going to go to the library and afterwards to visit his  grandmother. I am just 
coming from the library and Juan wasn’t there.

‘He must be sixty years (old).’ 
Faller (2007: 4) 
Weber (1986) analyses the Huánuco Quechua =chi as encoding conjecture, but does 
not discuss the notion in more detail. Instead, he points out that =chi-marked 
statements are a useful way of avoiding committing oneself to the truth of one’s 
utterance. He also mentions that the conjectural marker cannot initiate conversation, 
and that it is used to mark a query, as well as for a range of discursive effects, 
including irony and sarcasm. These observations do not apply to  the Tena Kichwa 
=cha, apart from one – that the marker can be used to query the addressee.  
Floyd (1997: chap.5) analyses the meaning of the Wanka Quechua -chr(a) as 
prototypically indicating the that utterance is an inference. The prototypical meaning  
of the marker is attenuation in the domain of commitment, which ‘equates non -
incorporation into reality (…) and is encoded in terms of likelihood values’ (Floyd 
1997: 106). He further claims that the non -prototypical uses of =chr(a) have to do 
with attenuation in other domains. Accordi ng to Floyd, those domains include e.g. 
‘psychological distance between the addressee and the proposition’, which results in 
second person future clauses marked with =chr(a) to be interpreted as ‘mild 
exhortations’, which, unlike the =mi-marked clauses, place the addressee under no 
obligation to answer. He also reports th at the marker is used to achieve the rhetorical 
effect of irony , and in utterances similar to rhetorical questions. Thus, the range of 
discourse effects he reports for the conjectural mark er is similar to those mentioned 
by Weber (1986). While uses of  =cha in irony  have not been attested in the TK 
corpus, the marker does occur in rhetorical questions (see Section 4.5.4 and 5.3.4).   
Although Floyd does not use that term, the fact that  he analyses the marker as 
encoding commitment to the likelihood of propositions amounts to an 
evidential/modal analysis, which is the one that Faller (2002; 2007) proposes in her 
work on Cuzco Quechua. According to Faller, the conjectural marker is the only CQ 
evidential that is both an evidential and  an epistemic modal. The evidential meaning 
 
331 
 
of =chá is to indicate that the speaker ‘bases his or her statement on a mental 
process’, be it inference, conjecture, guesswork o r any other process involving 
reasoning (Faller 2002: 176) . However, if the speaker bases her statement on partial 
direct evidence, -chus hina, which occurs in complementary distrib ution with other 
evidential enclitics (Faller 2006), is preferred over -chá: 
(5.11)  
Context: Marya looks very pale. 
a. ?Unqu-sqa-chá    ka-sha-n-man 
 sick-PRT-CONJ   be-PROG-3-COND 
 ‘She may be sick.’ 
b. Unqu-sqa-chus hina  ka-sha-n-man 
          sick-PRT-RES   be-PROG-3-COND  
 ‘She appears to be sick.’ 
Faller (2007: 4)  
The marker -chus hina /chu shina means roughly ‘ I guess ’, ‘ I think ’, ‘apparently’ 
(Faller 2006: 3). Its distribution and translation suggest it might function in similar 
contexts as the =mi yachin (=mi seem-3) construction in TK (see Section 5.3.3.4). 
In CQ, -chá cannot be used  if the speaker  is certain that the proposition is true or 
false, even if she arrived at that conclusion through reasoning (Faller 2007: 5). This 
supports the epistemic modal anal ysis of -chá. For a -chá-marked proposition to be 
felicitous, the speaker needs to believe in the possibility that the proposition 
expressed is true, as well as having arrived at that belief by her own reasoning.  
In Faller’s view, -chá is an illocutionary modifier of ‘evidential sincerity conditions’, 
adding to them that the speaker has arrived at the proposition by his own reasoning. 
As an epistemic modal, -chá also adds a possibility operator to the proposition 
expressed (cf. Faller 2002: sec. 5.2; 2007). From the illocutionary operator analysis, 
it follows that -chá does not  contribute to the truth -conditional meaning of 
propositions, which is confirmed by its embeddability and scope properties (see 
Section 5.3.4.1). The marker is not embeddable in conditional antecedent s, cannot 
scope under negat ion, and cannot be part of a questioned proposition (cf. Faller 
 
332 
 
2007). She further suggests that -chá and other CQ illocutionary modifiers, including 
the other two evidentials, operate on the speech act weaker than assertion, i.e. on th e 
act of putting the proposition forward, and that assertion arises if the proposition 
which is put forward is not subject to illocutionary modification (cf. Faller 2007) . 
Faller (2007) also contrasts the CQ -chá with two ‘pu re’ epistemic modal enclitics: 
the conditional -man and the certainty enclitic -puni. As far as the data show, neither 
of these are attested in TK.  
As shown in the previous paragraphs, all the current accounts of the 
indirect/inferential evidential point to the marker encoding inference based on 
different types of reasoning, as well as having an epistemic modal meaning. 
However, there are important distributional differences between the inferential 
markers in the varieties discussed above, and in TK. In Section 5.3.4, I show that the 
accounts given above only partially correspond to the semantics of the TK =cha.  
 Semantics of the ‘evidential’ markers in Tena Kichwa 5.3
In the preceding section, I discussed the different analyses of the Quechuan 
evidential paradigm. I now turn to the TK cognates of the direct ( =mi) and indirect 
(=cha) evidential markers.  First, I demonstrate that there is little alignment between 
the hierarchies of sources of information presented in Section  5.1.3 and the 
distribution of =mi and =cha in TK (5.3.1). Following on from that, I briefly define 
the notions of sent ential and illocutionary force ( 5.3.2). Consequently, I discuss the 
meaning of =mi (5.3.3) and =cha (5.3.4), proposing that in TK they encode the 
origo’s epistemic primacy (=mi) or lack thereof (=cha). Lastly, I discuss the level of 
meaning on which the TK epistemic primacy markers contribute to the clause (5.3.5).  
 Evidential hierarchies and the TK ‘evidential’ markers  5.3.1
In this section, I compare the distribution of TK =mi and =cha in propositions 
carrying different evidential va lues with that of their cognates from other Quechuan 
varieties (see Section 5.2). This comparison demonstrates that TK =mi and =cha do 
not align with direct/best possible evidence and indirect evidence, respectively. If 
=mi and =cha encoded evidential meanings, their distribution with respect to 
 
333 
 
different sources of evidence should be similar to that presented in  Figure 5.4 above. 
In order to establish whether this is in fact the case, I  conducted elicitation sessions 
comprising sentences with different evidential values. The elicitation was only run 
with three speakers (two male, one female, age range 28-47), but the patterns attested 
in it were confirmed by naturalistic discourse data, obtained from a greater number 
of speakers (20+). 
Each of the speakers was presented with 33 Spanish sentences in context, and asked 
to translate them into TK. The examples were designed so as to allow comparison 
with the previous studies of Quechuan  evidential markers (see  Section 5.2). They 
encompassed statements for which the speaker had a variety of direct and indirect 
evidence, including conjecture, inference and different types reported evidence (see 
Table 5.1 in Section 5.1.3). Examples were also included to test whether ‘evidential’ 
enclitics would surface in statements based on best possible ground as understood by 
Faller (2002) (see Section 5.2.2.1).  
The elicitation data have shown no correlation between the distribution of =mi or 
=cha and particular types of sources of evid ence. The marker =mi occurred in 
utterances for which the speaker has all the different sources of evidence: direct  
(5.12), reportative (5.13), inferential and/or conjectural, as in (5.14) and (5.15), while 
=cha was virtually absent from the data. Consider: 
(5.12) =mi with direct evidence 
tamya  -w      =mi 
rain    -PROG   =mi 
‘It is raining.’ [speaker sees that it’s raining].

el_18092014_01   051 
Example (5.12) is in line with the use of =mi in other Quechuan varieties , since the 
marker indicates that the speaker has direct, visual evidence. The utterance can also 
be made w ithout =mi (see Section  5.3.2). The use of =mi in the reportative 
construction in  (5.13) could also be accounted for in evidential terms  (see Section 
5.3.3.2). The examp les that put  the direct/BPG evidential analysis of =mi into 
question are (5.14) and (5.15), where =mi marks statements based on inference and 
conjecture. If the distribution of =mi and =cha in TK wa s similar to that in other 
varieties, we would expect the inference to be expressed with =cha. However, as we 
see below, such an utterance is not felicitous in TK: 
(5.16)  
a.   #tamia-shka=cha 
         rain  -ANT=cha  
         Intended meaning: ‘It rained.’ / ‘It must have rained.’  
 [speaker conjectures that it rained]  
b. tamia-shka=cha? 
rain   -ANT=cha 
‘Has it rained?’ / ‘It has rained, hasn’t it?’ 
el_18092014_01  02 
 
335 
 
My consultants pointed out that while example  (5.16a) is grammatical, it  is not 
felicitous as an assertive utterance, but rather should be used as a question or request 
for confirmation, as in (5.16b).  
In elicitation, consultants consistently interpreted  =cha-marked utterances as 
interrogative. In naturalistic discourse, =cha-marked declaratives are attested, but are 
interpreted as rhetorical questions rather than assertions.  Unlike its Cuzco Quechua 
cognate (cf. Faller 2002:175; 2006; 2007) , the TK =cha can occur in statements 
based on ‘direc t, but unclear evidence’. As mentioned in Section  5.2.2.2 (see 
example (5.11)), the CQ -chá cannot occur in contexts where partial evidence is 
available, since in those cases the expression -chus hi na (‘I guess’/‘apparently’) is 
preferred (cf. Faller 2006; 2007). Consider:  
(5.17) Cuzco Quechua 
a. Para-sha-n-chá. 
 rain-PROG-3-CONJ 
 ‘It is raining.’ [It’s been raining the last few days, so speaker conjectures that it 
 is/might be raining now.] 
Faller (2007: 5) 
b. Para-sha-n-chus     hina53  
 rain-PROG-3-DUB  
‘I think/guess it is raining.’ [Speaker hear something that sound s like rainfall   
 on the roof, but is not entirely sure that it is rain.] 
Faller (2006: 3) 
In TK, when presented with context similar to that in (5.17b), the consultants also did 
not use =cha. Instead, they contributed the following utterances:  
 
 
                                                 
53 In the original glossing of this example the whole expression -chus hina  was glossed with one 
gloss: DUB/dubitative (cf. Faller 2006), 
 
336 
 
(5.18)  
Context: The speaker wakes up in the morning and sees the ground is wet.

b. Kuna  tuta  tamya-shka(=mi) 
          today night rain-ANT  (=mi) 
          ‘It rained last night.’  
elicited 
It could be argued that  (5.17a) a nd (5.18) are not strictly comparable, since the 
former is an inference from incomplete evidence, and the latter – from results. 
However, the =mi yachin construction (see Section 5.3.3.4) is also attested in cases 
of inference from partial evidence, as in (5.19):  
(5.19)  
ñuka   yaya     shamu-w       =mi      yachi -n  
1SG      father       come -PROG=mi      seem -3  
‘It seems my father is coming. ’ [Speaker hears footsteps outside, and was expecting 
his father to come]  
el_21092014_01 035  
As mentioned above and shown in  (5.16), out -of-the-blue utterances marked with 
=cha were consistently interpreted as requests  for information/confirmation. In 
elicitation contexts, the constr uction =mi yachin (=mi seem-3), shown in  (5.18) and 
(5.19), was preferred in statements based on partial evidence. However, as shown by 
(5.18), an unmarked proposition, or =mi alone, are also permissible. In naturalistic 
discourse utterances based on partial or unclear evidence were also marked by =cha:  
 
                                                 
54 An issue which remains to be explored in further research is the role of the ANT marker -shka in 
such constructions and its interaction with discour se enclitics. This tense marker tends to be used in 
mirative contexts (see  Section 2.4.2.2.3).  
 
337

‘What was his name, I think they called him Shangri…’ 
in_26052013_02   132 
Example (5.20) comes from a life story/interview. The speaker knew the person 
whom she is trying to remember, but her memory is failing . In CQ, the 
inferential/conjectural evidential would not be permissible in such context (cf. Faller 
2002: sec. 5.2). 
The above examples show that while the dubitative meaning proposed for its 
cognates can be upheld for the TK =cha, the enclitic does not pattern like an 
inferential/conjectural evidential. In out-of-the-blue utterances, it receives 
interrogative interpretation, and when it occurs in declaratives in discourse, they tend 
to be interpreted as rhetorical questions. Moreover, both =mi and =cha can occur in 
statements based on partial or incomplete evidence . In the following sections, I show 
that the distribution of both markers can be accounted for if they are analysed as 
markers of epistemic authority (=mi) and lack thereof (=cha).  
 Clause types in TK and related notions 5.3.2
In the ensuing discussion of the TK  ‘evidential markers’, the notions of clause type, 
speech act, sentential force and illocu tionary force will be relevant.  In this section, I 
briefly define these notions.  
Speech acts can be defined as sentences uttered within a context of discourse (Searle 
1969: 17-18). Clause types are not dependent on the discourse context, although 
there often is a  coincidence between the grammatical structure of the clause and its 
conventional conversational use  (Sadock & Zwicky 1985:  156; Koenig & Siemund 
2007: 282). Nonetheless, to be cross -linguistically useful, the distinction between 
clause types need to be based on formal criteria (Koenig & Siemund 2007:  278). 
Consequently, clause types correspond to the syntactic forms of c lauses and can 
differ from one another in terms of their internal structure (e.g. transitive vs 
 
338 
 
intransitive), syntactic function (main vs subordinate) 55, or – most importantly from 
the point of view of this study – the types of speech acts they typically c onvey (cf. 
Aikhenvald 2015: 225). The three major sentence types attested cross -linguistically 
are: declaratives, interrogatives and imperatives. Clause/sentence types of a language 
form a system of mutually exclusive choices: one clause cannot belong to two clause 
types (cf. Sadock & Zwicky 1985:158-9; Koenig & Siemund 2007: 278).  
Therefore, a crucial difference between a sentence type and a speech act  lies in how 
the former relates to syntactic  – and in many cases, prosodic - structures. While a 
given syntactic structure can only belong to one sentence type, it can map onto 
multiple speech acts. Consider: 
(5.21)  
Have you watered the flowers yet?  
Sentence type:     interrogative 
Speech act1: question (S wants to know whether A has watered the flowers) 
Speech act2: request (S wants A to water the flowers) 
The lack of one -to-one mapping between sentential forms and speech acts has been 
captured by the notion of ‘indi rect speech acts’ (Searle 1979) , but the distinction 
between speech acts and sentence types remains valid.   
This clause type/speech act distinction leads to  distinguishing sentential force from 
illocutionary force. Sentential force is a ‘semantic correlate of a [syntactic] sentence 
type’ (cf. Chierchia & McConnell-Ginet 1990: 165). Illocutionary force, on the other 
hand, is the speaker’s intention in producing an utterance, and is dependent on the 
communicative context of the utterance (cf. e.g. Austin 1962; Searle 1976) . In sum, 
sentence type is a morphosyntactic category, and sentential force, directly correlating 
with sentence type, is also grounded in morphosyntax. The notions of speech act and 
illocutionary force are  pragmatic rather than morphosyntactic. They only arise in  
communicative contexts and are often not marked by a single grammatical c ategory 
(cf. Bruil 2014: 41). 
                                                 
55 The term ‘sentence type’ is also used to discuss independent/main clauses (Aikhenvald 2015: 234). 
 
339 
 
Sadock and Zwicky (1985: 160) propose that the following cross-linguistically valid 
‘division of labour’ between the three main sentence types: 
The declarative is subject to judgments of truth and falsehood, it is used 
for making announcements, stating conclusions, making claims, relating 
stories, and so on. The interrogative elicits verbal response from the 
addressee. It is used principally to gain information. The imperative 
indicates the speaker’s desire to influence future events. It is of service in 
making requests, giving orders, making suggestions, and the like. 
Portner (2006), who an alyses sentential force in the s DRT56 framework, attributes 
different sentential forces to the three main sente nce types. The sentential force of 
declaratives is asserting, for interrogatives – asking, and for imperatives – requiring. 
Interrogatives can be used to request information, or to introduce questions to the set 
of questions under discussion. Once these qu estions are resolved, the corresponding 
proposition is added to the common ground (henceforth CG, see Section 4.1.1). 
Declarative clauses introduce propositions which, in the absence of mitigating 
circumstances, are added directly to the CG. Imperatives, on the other hand, do not 
add content to the CG, but rather to the to -do lists of participants (2006: 3-4). 
Therefore, the declaratives and interrogatives differ from the imperatives in the type 
of ‘conversational update’ they provide. In Gricean pra gmatics, this mismatch 
between declaratives and interrogatives on the one hand, and imperatives on the 
other, is analysed in terms of differing ‘direction of fit’ between the words and the 
world (Searle 1976). In case of declarative s and interrogatives, the direction of fit is 
from the words to the world – the utterances need to match an independently existing 
state of affairs. In case of imperatives, the direction of fit is the opposite – from 
words to world – since the utterance is an attempt to influence  a state of affairs 
existing in the world. It follows that declaratives and interrogatives on the one hand, 
and imperatives on the other, vary with respect to whether they can be bound by 
existential quantifiers. Existential quantification over an event in troduces existential 
closure over the whole proposition (cf. Matić & Nikolaeva 2014:  204). Propositions 
within the scope of existential quantification can only denote events actualised in t he 
text-external world. Therefore, existential closure is compatible with declarative and 
interrogative clauses which entail actualisation of events. Imperatives, on the other 
                                                 
56 Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (cf. e.g. Asher 1993). 
 
340 
 
hand, cannot be bound by existential closure, since the direction of fit the y represent 
is ‘from word to world’, and therefore incompatible with actualised events.  
The opposing directions of fit characterising declaratives and interrogatives on the 
one hand, and imperatives on the other, are also associated with different types of 
origo authority. In case of declarative  and interrogative clauses, the authority of the 
origo is epistemic, related to ‘knowing how the world is’, and indexed to the speaker 
and the addressee, respectively. In imperatives, the origo is the speaker and the ty pe 
of authority they hold is deontic – associated with determining ‘how the world ought 
to be’ (Stevanovic & Peräkylä  2012: 298). The above describes the ‘conventional 
conversational uses’ of the different clause types, postulated to be valid cross -
linguistically. How these correl ate with grammatical  structures is a more language -
specific issue.  
In TK, like in many other languages, declarative s are the predominant sentence type. 
In contrast to imperatives, declaratives exhibits a full paradigm of tense and aspect 
combinations (cf. König & Siemund 2007: 285) . In TK, declarative main clauses are 
also characterised by a r elatively free word order (see Section 4.3). Apart from 
morphosyntactic features, declaratives can also be distingu ished from other clause 
types on a prosodic basis . T hey are characterised by falling intonation. Prosodic 
structure is crucial for distinguishing TK declaratives from i nterrogatives, which 
exhibit rising intonation. Polar interrogatives also do not have a fixed word order and 
optionally contain a range of interrogative markers, the distribution of which is 
related to focus articul ation of the clause  (see Chapter 3). Wh- interrogative clauses 
contain interrogative pronouns , which tend to occur clause -initially, as well as 
optional interrogative enclitics (see Chapter 3  and Chapter 4 ). In TK imperative 
clauses, the verb does not inflect for tense. The imperative verb form is either a bare 
verb stem or a stem with imperative or hortative marker attachin g to its immediate 
right.  
 The semantics of =mi: claiming epistemic authority 5.3.3
In Section 5.3.1, I have shown that the TK =mi does not encode the direct evidential 
meaning. Nonetheless, it patterns similarly to its cognates in terms of grammatical 
and discourse contexts in which it occurs (see Section  5.2.2.1). The enclitic is not 
 
341 
 
grammatically obligatory, and it cannot occur in imperative utterances. Assertions 
marked with =mi are perceived by TK spe akers as stronger than the unmarked ones . 
Similarly to what  Faller observed for Cuzco Quechua  (2002: 54), speakers seem to 
use =mi when they anticipate a potential challenge and want to claim authority over 
the information conveyed . In the sections that follow,  I show that the TK =mi is a 
marker of epistemic authority/primacy. First , I examine the type of  contribution it 
makes to the propo sition expressed ( 5.3.3.1), showing that it encodes procedural 
rather than propositional meaning. Following on from that, I examine the meaning of 
=mi with examples of its use in root declarative (5.3.3.2) and interrogative clauses  
(5.3.3.3). Finally, I discuss the properties of =mi in embedded clauses ( 5.3.3.4) and 
provide a short summary (5.3.3.5). Since =mi does not occur in imperatives, they are 
not discussed here. 
5.3.3.1 =mi and the proposition expressed 
In this s ection, I show that the TK =mi encodes non-truth conditional meaning , in 
line with what has been suggested by the previous analyses . Although only Faller 
(2002) stated it explicitly, analysing =mi as an illocutionary operator modifying the 
truth conditions of an utterance,  other analyses of =mi mentioned in Secti on 5.2.2.1 
also assume the meaning of the marker  is non -truth-conditional (cf. Weber 1986; 
Floyd 1997).  
In the literature, two types of tests are standardly used to determine the type of 
contribution a linguistic element makes to an utterance : ‘the challengeability test ’  
and ‘the embedding test ’ (Faller 2002: sec. 3.5.3) . A more detailed array of tests 
applied specifically to evidentials  is proposed by Peterson (2010: sec. 3.5). Below, I 
apply those of his tests that make di fferent predictions for the ‘modal’ and ‘non -
modal’ evidentials (see Section  5.1.1), namely: (1) the known tru th/falsity test, (2) 
the ‘challengeability test’57, (3) the embeddability test and (4) the interrogative scope 
test. The first two involve truth value of the tested element, while the latter two have 
to do with issues of scope and embedding.  
The known trut h/falsity test relies on the assumption that epistemic modals are not 
felicitous when the speaker knows the truth value of the assertion, since they are used 
                                                 
57 The ‘challengeability’ test is a label used by Faller (2002: sec. 3.5.3). Peterson (2010: sec. 3.5) calls 
it the ‘assent/dissent test’. 
 
342 
 
to quantify over epistemically accessible possible words (cf. Matthewson 2011). The 
TK =mi, like its cognate in Cuzco Quechua , does not weaken the assertion in the 
way that e.g. English epistemic modal verbs do, but rather makes it stronger/more 
emphatic (Faller 2002: chap. 4) . Example s shown above, as well as (5.22) below, 
show =mi-marked statement s are felicitous  when the speaker knows that the 
proposition expressed by that statement is a fact. Therefore, =mi behaves unlike a 
modal marker in that it does not indicate an epistemic possibility.  
The challengeability test  is based on the assumption that if an expression carries a 
truth-conditional meaning, i.e. affects the truth conditions of the utterance (see 
Section 3.1), it can be challenged: questioned, doubted, rejected or disagreed with. 
Non-truth conditional elements, on the other hand, do not specify how the word 
should be for the utterance to be true, and therefore are non-challengeable. Consider:  
(5.22)  
a. Ñuka   yaya   shamu-w      =mi 
1SG  father  come-PROG=mi 
‘My father is coming.’ 
b. Ari,  cierto=mi 
yes sure=mi 
‘Yeah, that’s true.’ 
c. Shina=cha? 
like.this=cha 
‘Is that so?’  
d. Mana! 
NEG 
‘No’ 
elicited 
If a native speaker of TK u tters (5.22a), plausible responses, depending on the 
situational context, include (5.22b), (5..22c) or (5.22d). All of the answers relate to  
the proposition that the speaker’s father is coming, and not to the speaker’s source of 
evidence or claim to epistemic authority. Example (5.22) is analogous to those 
 
343 
 
proposed by Faller (2002: 157-8) for the CQ =mi, which is also  non-challengeable. 
Utterance (5.23) is an infelicitous attempt to challenge the evidential meaning of =mi 
in a CQ utterance analogous to (5.22a): 
(5.23) Cuzco Quechua (QII)  
Mana-n  chiqaq-chu.  # Mana-n  chay-ta  riku-rqa-nki-chu. 
not=mi  true-NEG     not=mi  this-ACC  see-PST1-2-NEG 
‘That's not true. You didn't see this.’ 
Faller (2002: 158) 
Example (5.23) is an attempt to question the BPG – in this case, correspond ing to 
visual evidence – of the speaker of  (5.22a) to make an assertion.  However, a n 
attempt to challenge the TK =mi cannot rely on negating the source of evidence. As I 
show in Section 5.3.1, the TK =mi does not correlate either with direct evidence, or 
with BPG. If, as I hypothesised above,  it marks epistemic authority, (5.22a) should 
rather be challenged by a statement along the lines of (5.24): 
(5.24)  
Mana!   #  Kan      mana  yacha-ngui=chu  chi-ta=ga  ! 
NEG  #  2SG    NEG  know-2=Q/NEG D.DEM-ACC=ga 
‘No! you don’t know that!’  
elicited 
As a response to (5.22a), speakers judge (5.24) infelicitous and (5.25) – felicitous: 
(5.25)  
Mana!   Shuj=mi a-n.  
NEG  one =mi COP-3 
‘No, it’s someone else!’ 
elicited 
Example (5.25) challenges the proposition that the father is coming, and not the 
speaker’s epistemic authority to make such a claim.  
The reliability of this kind of evidence is questionable, however.  The utterance of 
(5.24) could be judged infelicitous for a variety of reasons, e.g. the fact that it makes 
 
344 
 
a claim about the direct perception of someone else but the speaker, contradicting 
what the interlocutor has previously said. Such behaviour can be considered rude and 
therefore inacceptable, independently of the contribution of =mi to the assertion in 
(5.22a). While these doubts should be kept in mind in eliciting felicity and/or 
grammaticality judgments, I take the results above to plausibly indicate that, on the 
basis of the ‘chall engeability’ test, the TK =mi can be considered non -truth-
conditional. 
The second set of tests suggested by Peterson (2010: sec. 3.5) has to do with scope 
and embeddability of the tested expression. These tests are  based on the assumption 
that propositional operator s affect  the truth conditions of utterance s, and therefore 
truth-conditional elements ‘should be able to fall within the scope of other 
propositional operators such as if’ (Peterson 2010: 108) . Consequently, non -truth 
conditional elements, which cannot be understood as part of the semantic content of 
the clause, are not expected to  interact with, or  be embeddable under, propositional 
operators such as negation or conditionals. However, this view is challenged by more 
recent literature, which shows that some illocutionary elements can be embedded (cf. 
Krifka 2013; 2014; Faller 2014; Woods 2016).  
The TK =mi is embeddable in a limited range of contexts. From the discussion above 
regarding the impossibility of challenging the meaning encoded by =mi, it follows 
that the marker  always scopes over negation. On the other hand, attempts of 
embedding =mi in conditional antecedents deliver mixed results , which should be 
explored in detail in further research.  
The two environments attested in the corpus where =mi can be embedded are: under 
factive verbs, including verbs of speech and thinking, and under the non -factive verb 
yachin (‘seem-3’). Consider:  
(5.26)  
chi     churiwa…    ñuka   iyakani               churiwami...          
chi     churi -wa     ñuka   iya-ka-ni      churi-wa  =mi      
D.DEM  son   -DIM    1SG   think-PST-1      son  -DIM=mi     
 
 
345 
 
paywa          churi  manga               nisha... 
pay   -pa      churi=mi     a       -nga    ni    -sha 
3SG -GEN     son   =mi     COP -FUT    say   -COR 
‘This little boy…I though t [he was the farmer’s] son, I said/thought, it’s going to be 
his son.’ 
el_21092014_02   69 
In (5.26), =mi occurs in a speech complement introduced by the complementiser 
nisha (‘say-COR’), derived from a verb of speech  ni- (say). In (5.26) the first 
occurrence of =mi is embedded under the factive verb iya- (‘think’), and the second 
– which could also be disambiguated as =ma – under nisha. The discussion above 
demonstrates that the embeddability test deliver mixed results for =mi. In Section  
5.3.3.4, I discuss the occurrence of =mi in embedded clauses in more detail.  
The final test which I consider here is the interrogative scope test , based on the 
assumption that modal operators ‘cannot take scope over an illocutionary act, such as 
performing a request/asking a question’ (Peterson 2010: 112). In the case of this test 
as well, more recent research shows that non-compatibility of discourse markers with 
certain clause -types does not preclude their illocutionary analysis (cf. Coniglio & 
Zegrean 2012).  
In the TK, =mi occurs in declarative and interrogative contexts, but is not compatible 
with imperative morphology:  
(5.27)  
a. miku-y! 
eat-2SG.IMP 
‘Eat!’ 
b. *miku-y=mi!

shows that =mi cannot co -occur on the same host with imperative markers, and 
scope over speech acts of requesting. Such distribution of =mi in speech acts could 
suggest that t he occurrence of the marker is related to existential closure . This 
hypothesis is undermined by the fact that =mi, though ungrammatical in imperatives, 
can occur in other constructions which do not provide existential anchoring of events 
(see Section 5.3.3.2). In the following section, I show that the incompatibility of =mi 
with imperative clauses should rather be attributed to the fact that =mi encodes the 
origo’s epistemic authority, which is compatible with declaratives and i nterrogatives, 
but not with imperatives. In the latter case the authority of the origo is not epis temic, 
but deontic (see Section 5.3.2). 
In this section, I have discussed the behaviour of =mi with respect to a series of tests 
that are standardly applied in order to determine the type of semantic contribution a 
linguistic expression makes to the utterance. The truth-falsity test has shown that 
=mi can occur on propositions which the speaker knows to be true, and therefore 
patterns like non-modal evidentials in this respect. The marker has also proven to be 
non-challengeable. On the basis of those two tests, the TK =mi can be analysed as 
non-truth conditional. 
The tests related to scope and embedding were originally aimed at estab lishing 
whether a marker can be analysed as an illocutionary modifier. Embeddability and 
scoping under speech acts were taken as evidence for the non -illocutionary nature of 
the markers (cf. Peterson 2010) . However, more recently it has been argued that 
discourse particles interact both with clause type and illocutionary for ce – they can 
be restricted to certain clause types, and at the same time contribute to illocutionary 
force of utterances by modifying the speaker’s  communicative intention (Coniglio & 
Zegrean 2012: 230).

In the sections that follow, I discuss the occurrences of =mi in different clause types. 
I also show whether and how =mi influences the illocutionary force of utterances. I 
come back to TK discourse enclitic and the levels of meaning in Section 5.3.5.  
5.3.3.2 =mi in declarative clauses 
In this section, I discuss the occurrences of =mi in declarative clauses, showing that 
the TK =mi should be analysed as a marker of epistemic authority/primacy: marking 
the relative right to know or claim, or the authority over  knowledge (see Section 
5.1.2). I understand epistemic primacy as being closely related, but not tantamount to, 
the best possible ground (BPG) as defined by Faller (2002). She, and other authors 
researching Quechuan evidentiality  (e.g. Floyd 1997; Nuckolls 2012)  recognise the 
origo’s authority over the information as an  important component of the meaning of 
the direct evidential. According to Faller, the two components of the BPG, necessary 
to make a =mi-marked assertion, are: (1) having the best possible source of evidence 
and (2) authority over the information (2002: chap. 4) . In TK, only the latter is 
necessary – the use of =mi is dependent on the speaker’s having (or wanting to 
project) the authority over the information,  but this perceived authority need not be 
dependent on direct evidence.  
Consider e xample (5.28), which  comes from a conversation about the Pear Story  
(Chafe 1980). The speaker claims that a stone over which the protagonist trips had 
been put on the road by a group of three boys. This is a conjecture, since it did not 
appear in the video, and in other varieties of Quechua  (5.28) could not have been 
felicitously marked with =mi. The example is felicitous in TK, since the speaker 
believes that he has just realised something that is not apparent to his interlocutor and 
uses =mi to index epistemic authority.  
(5.28)

Similar examples come from a staged conversation about the results of several three-
shell games with a seed and three nut shells . Two consultants watched the games on 
video. First, they saw each game  without the final e, and were asked to guess where 
the seed was. Then, they watched the same trick until the end, when the final location 
of the seed was revealed . Since statements based on guesswork and conjecture are 
marked by the inferential/conjectural in other varieties, I was expecting the speakers 
to use =cha. However, =cha did not occur at all in the 10 -minute recording (113 
turns). Instead, the speaker’s guesses were often marked by =mi:  
(5.29)  
lluki      pura-ma=mi             ri-n,   lluki pura-ma 
left        side-DAT=mi     go -3   left       side-DAT

‘the [one] that has the seed stays on this side’ 
el_03102014_01   115 
In both examples, the speakers have good grounds to think their perception could be 
mistaken; they have already watched several tricks and never guessed correctly. 
Consequently, their use of =mi goes against the  analysis of the enclitic as marking 
BPG, since  the speaker needs to believe having the BPG to  use a =mi-marked 
utterance (Faller 2002: chap.4). The examples above are felicitous, h owever, if =mi 
is analysed as encoding epistemic authority. Under this analysis, by using =mi, each 
speaker mak es a claims as to the ‘depth, specificity or completeness of their 
knowledge’, try ing to c onvince the interlocutor that his insight is privileged  and 
grants him the ‘primary right’ to assess the situation in the video (cf. Stivers et al. 
2011: 13). As mentioned previously, an alternative interpretation of =mi as a marker 
of asserti ve speech act  is ruled out b y the fact that it also occurs in interrogative 
clauses (see Section 5.2.2.1). 
 
349 
 
The uses of =mi prototypical for other varieties, where the origo has the BPG for 
making an assertion, are also accounted for if =mi is analysed as marking epistemic 
authority. Both BPG and epistemic authority can be claimed with respect to 
information integrated in one’s system of beliefs, and coming from direct experience, 
or learnt from authority (Faller 2002: chap. 4). In TK, =mi also occurs in these cases:  
(5.31)  
Chi-raygu   kuna-gama  wayusa  upi-shka  tuku-shka  
D.DEM-CAUSAL now-LAT guayusa drink-ANT become-ANT

‘Because of this, until now the drinking of the guayusa has been known (practiced ) 
by all, guayusa is very good.’ 
KICHB07AGOPEDROCHIMBO2   072 
In (5.31), a community elder talks about the custom of drinking guayusa .58 In the 
=mi-marked statement, the speaker invokes cultural knowledge about guayusa, 
alongside his personal experience.  
In declarative clauses, origo corresponds to the speaker (see Section 5.1.1). Therefore, 
evidentials and other epistemic perspective  markers are ‘anchored’ to the speaker, 
and by default represent her point of view (cf. e.g. Bruil 2014; Bergqvist 2015) . 
Consequently, it is to b e expected that the marking of epistemic authority is  
redundant in first person subject clauses , where the speaker is entitled to ‘epistemic 
privilege’(cf. Dickinson 2016) by virtue of being the primary actor in the situation he 
talks abou t. Therefore, marking of origo’s epistemic authority in 1SUBJ clauses 
should be associated with a pragmatically marked reading of such clauses. This is in 
fact the case in TK. Consider:  
(5.32)  
pagrachu-ni=mi  pay  shamu-shka-manda

in_26052013_02   271 
Example (5.32) comes from a political speech, and (5.33) from a life-story interview. 
In both cases, =mi with a 1SUBJ verb does not affect the semantic  content of the 
propositions conveye d. Nonetheless, both =mi-marked stateme nts seem to convey 
greater intentionality on behalf of the speaker th an would be conveyed by an 
unmarked assertion. In (5.32), a member of the village government emphatically 
thanks his superior for attending. In  (5.33), the speaker recounts how she recovered 
from an illness that had almost killed her unborn child. The occurrence of =mi in 
1SUBJ clauses is often found in political speeches, presumably to increase the 
argumentative force of utterances.59  
Pragmatic effects arise also when =mi is used in 2SUBJ clauses. In TK, 2SUBJ 
declaratives are generally considered rude. In elicitation, my consultants rejected 
2SUBJ declaratives and suggested interrogative equivalents instead. In the corpus, 
2SUBJ cl auses mostly occur in interrogatives or in speech complements. This is 
possibly due to the fact that in 2SUBJ declaratives there is a mismatch between the 
origo/speaker and the ‘epistemic source’ (Hargreaves 2005 ) of the proposition, 
corresponding to the addressee. While TK speakers reject unmarked ‘out -of-the-blue’ 
2SUBJ declaratives, 2SUBJ declaratives with =mi are considered felicitous:  
(5.34) = (2.80) 
a. #Juan,   pantalon-da  liki-ngui  / liki-nga    ra-w-ngui. 
NAME  trousers -ACC  rip-2        / rip-FUT    AUX-PROG-2

59 Although I have not conducted prosodic analysis of such constructions, preliminary observations 
suggest that no special prosodic marking is involved in such contexts.

el_31052013_1   388 
Example (5.34a) was judged infelicitous. The consultant suggested a 3SUBJ clause 
in (5.34 b) instead. Example (5.34 c) was judged felicitous only  in a context  of 
scolding/warning a child. A similar effect, associated  with illocutionary force of  
encouragement, is shown in (5.35): 
(5.35)  
A: Mana   usha-ni 
 NEG  can-1 
 ‘I cannot (do this).’ 
B:     [kan]  ushan-gui=mi 
         [2SG]  can    -2   =mi 
   ‘[Yes, you] can!’ 
attested 
Example (5.35) comes from a conversation in which I was saying that I would not be 
able to prepare chicha, to which my friend replied with utterance B, encouraging me 
to try. When I asked another consultant whether (5.35B) would be felicitous without 
=mi, it was judged  odd and lacking argumentative force. In (5.36) =mi is used with 
the same modal verb interpreted deontically:  
(5.36)  
Payna    mana   kumbira-k-llayra, 
3PL   NEG   invite  -AG.NMLZ -CON 
miku-na-ra        usha-ngui=mi.

‘Even if they don’t invite you, you can eat.’  
el_02102013    177 
 
352 
 
In (5.36) the speaker informs the addressee that it is socially appropriate to eat 
without being invited. The illocutionary force of the utterance is permission . 
Example (5.36) demonstrates that despite being ungrammatical with imperative 
morphology, =mi is compatible with hortative illocut ionary acts. Consider also 
another use of =mi in a concessive clause in (5.37):  
(5.37)  
Kan  ansa =lla   upi-j-llayra    multa-nu-nga=mi 
2SG  some=LIM   drink -AG.NMLZ -CON  fine   -3SUBJ-FUT=mi 
‘Even if you just drink a little, they will fine you.’  
el_02102013    169 
In contrast to the permissive illocutionary force of the concessive clause in  (5.36), 
the utterance in (5.37) has an illocutionary force of a warning. Example  (5.37), as 
well as the previous ones, was judged grammatical – but not felicitous – without =mi.  
The pragmatic effects resulting from the co -occurrence of =mi with 2SUBJ are in 
line with similar phenomena attested in epistemic m arking systems in other 
languages. In Wutun (Sinitic, China), the egophoric marking co -occurring with 
2SUBJ results in performatives (Sandman 2016). In Tsafiki (Barbacoan, Ecuador) –
(Dickinson 2016)  the egophoric marker -yo co-occurs with 2SUBJ in scolding 
contexts, parallel to (5.34c) above. The common feature of examples (5.34) through 
(5.37) above is that =mi encodes epistemic authority anchored to the speaker, despite 
the subject being the default source of epistemic authority in 2SUBJ assertions. This 
gives rise to differing illocutionary forces, which can all be traced back to the 
speaker’s assertion of epistemic primacy. In (5.34) and (5.37) the illocutionary force 
is that of warning or advice, arising from superior life experience of the speaker (‘I 
know what will happen if you keep doing what you are doing!’). In  (5.35), the 
speaker preforms an illocutionary act of encouragement, asserting her ‘relative right 
to know’ with respect to the addressee’s skills (‘I’m telling you, you can do it!’). In  
(5.36), the illocutionary force of permission arises by virtue of the speaker’s superior 
knowledge of social norms (‘I know that it is appropriate for you to do it’).  
The examples above have also shown that while =mi is incompatible with imperative 
sentential force (see  (5.27)), it can occur in declaratives utterances with mild 
 
353 
 
hortative illocutionary force. The enclitic is also attested in a declarative construction 
involving the infinitive -na and auxiliary, used to express recommendations or 
requirements:  
(5.38)

‘You have to drink one [full] pot [of chicha] because of your [day], the Mother’s Day’ 
ev_15052013_07   007 
The constructions exemplified above often occur in instructions an d h ow-to-make 
texts. This contradicts  the observations made for =mi in other varieties (cf. Weber 
1986; Floyd 1997) , according to which  the enclitic does not occur in how -to-make 
texts. While direct evidence might not be relevant in giving instructions, epistemic 
primacy of the more experienced person is relevant to such contexts. However, 
unlike the previous examples, these constructions are also felicitous without =mi.  
Another construction which has not been mentioned in this section, and which 
constitutes a prototypical case of speaker’s epistemic primacy, is verum focus. In TK, 
it is most often marked with the dedicated enclitic =tá (see Section 4.5.2). However, 
=mi can also occur in such constructions. Consider:  
(5.40) = (4.50)

A:   ‘Yes, he has an apple, a red apple, and he also has…[he] has a plate of soup.’  
el_01122014_08   133-34 
The examples above show that both =mi and =tá can be used when the main 
assertion of the utterance is the positive polarity of the clause. In both (5.40) and 
(5.41), epistemic primacy lies with the speaker, who confirms to the addressee that 
what she was supposing is the case. The fact that both markers can occur in this 
contexts suggests that =tá could also encode epistemic primacy. In Chapter 6, I show 
that the difference between  =mi and =tá lies not in epistemic primacy value, but in 
the speaker’s expectation regarding the knowledge of the addressee. 
5.3.3.3 =mi in interrogative clauses 
In Section 5.1, I mention ed that epistemic marking systems are characterised by a 
perceiver/origo shift, whereby the epistemic markers are anchored to the speaker in 
declaratives, and to the addressee in interrogatives. This also obtains for the TK =mi:  
 
 
355 
 
(5.42)  
A:    Kan   kulki-ra  mana   chari-ngui=mi  ?  
 2SG  money-ACC NEG  have-2=mi 
B:    Ari,  mana   chari-ni=mi 
   yes NEG   have-1=mi 
A:  ‘You don’t have money[, do you]?’ 
B:  ‘No, I don’t.’ 
el_28112014_05 
The exchange in (5.42) is plausible in a situation where B has previously told A that 
he didn’t have money. Thus, A’s utterance could be seen as a confirmation question, 
following up on what B had said before.  This also shows that in both utterances, =mi 
is anchored to B, who has the epistemic primacy with respect to the information A 
enquires about. A ‘default’ polar interrogative with =chu is used when the speaker 
does not make any reference to the addressee’s authority to answer the question: 
(5.43)  
Kan   kullki-ra   chari-ngui=chu?  
2SG   money-ACC  have-2=Q/NEG 
‘Do you have money?’ 
attested 
The enclitic =mi occurs in interrogatives much less frequently than in declaratives. 
In his description of Quian (Tibeto-Burman), LaPolla states that evidentials are non -
obligatory in interrogatives, unless the speaker makes an assumption about the 
addressee’s source of information regarding the answer (2003: 73, cited in Bergqvist 
2015: 4). Faller (2002) made a similar observation for =mi in Cuzco Quechua. This 
interpretation could also be paraphrased to apply to TK, where it appears that =mi is 
only used in interrogatives if the speaker wishes to make an explicit reference to the 
addressee’s authority to answer the question. This is also confirmed by =mi 
occurring predominantly in requests for confirmation.    
 
 
356 
 
(5.44)  
Kan  boda-ma  ri-ka-ngui,  kan    yacha-ngui=mi    maka-nushka-ra ?

‘You went to the party, so you know [must] about the fight?’ 
el_24112014_03   499 
Example (5.44) contrasts with examples in the previous section, where 2SUBJ 
marking combined with =mi resulted in the reinf orcement of the speaker’s opinion, 
and ‘boosting’ of the default illocutionary force of the declarative. In (5.44), the 
epistemic authority encoded by =mi is deferred to the addressee. While both the 
above examples of =mi-marked interrogatives were confirmation questions, =mi can 
also occur in content questions:  
(5.45) = (5.6) = (4.79) 
Ima  shutimi? 
what name=mi  
‘What is her name?’ [asked to someone who knows the person in question]  
in_20092013_03   216 
The exact discourse contexts in which questions like (5.45) are preferred to 
epistemically unmarked interrogatives requires further investigation. This particular 
interrogative was uttered by a pers on who didn’t know me, when one of my 
consultants brought me to her house. Therefore, by uttering (5.45) the speaker was 
recognising my consultant’s authority to tell her about me, since the consultant 
already knew my name.  
The use of =mi in interrogative clauses seems to be a speaker’s subjective choice, 
depending on whether she wants to emphasise her interlocutor’s epistemic authority. 
In Section 5.3.4.3. I discuss the use of =cha in interrogatives, whereby the speaker 
achieves a similar effect by opposite means, that is, but downplaying their authority 
over the subject of the enquiry.  
5.3.3.4 =mi in embedded clauses 
In Section 5.3.3.1, I show that =mi can embed under verbs of  speech and thinking, 
and under the non-factive verb yachin (‘seem-3’). In this section, I discuss examples 
 
357 
 
of =mi in embedded contexts, and show how they can be reconciled with the analysis 
of =mi as an epistemic authority marker. In other Quechuan dialec ts, e.g. Cuzco 
Quechua, the evidential enclit ics occur in embedded questions (Faller 2014). In TK, 
however, this pattern was not attested in the corpus. The enclitic =mi is attested to 
occur in declarative embedded clauses.  
The most frequent context for embedding of =mi are speech complements, which are 
introduced by means of  the finite verb nin (‘say-3’), or the participle nisha (‘say-
COR’):  
(5.46)  
[Marcos  shamu-shka=mi ]CP ni-sha=mi   rima-nun 
NAME  come-ANT =mi say-COR=mi  talk-3PL 
‘They say [that] Marcos has come back.’  
el_18092014_01   059 
In (5.46), the speaker  uses the participle  nisha (‘say-COR’) together  with another 
verb of speech, rima- (‘talk’), which is the head of the main clause. The TK co-
reference suffix -sha indicates an action simultaneous to that of the main verb (see 
Section 2.5.3.2.3). However, in (5.46) interpreting nisha as a verb of speech would 
lead to redundancy (‘they talked, saying’). Therefore, it is plausible to assume that 
nisha is on the path to gr ammaticalising as a complementiser (cf. Bybee  et al.  
1994).60 This is confirmed by similar patterns attested in the elicited and naturalistic 
discourse parts of the corpus. Speech complements can also be introduced by nin 
(‘say-3’): 
(5.47)  
[Chi        rukumama  sara  punda-ma  kapari-n]CP   ni-n=mi        ni-n 
D.DEM    grandmother corn point-DAT shout-3         say-3=mi     say-3

ta_07062013_01    359 
                                                 
60  Verbs of speech  are a  cross-linguistically common source of  complementisers. Such 
complementisers have been attested e.g. in various African (cf. Güldemann 2008) , Tibeto -Burman 
(e.g. Saxena 1988) and Sinitic (e.g. Chappell 2008) languages, as well as in  creoles (e.g. Plag 1992).  
 
358 
 
Example (5.47) comes from a traditional narrative. In this case, the source of 
information cannot be traced back to a specific source, and nin functions as a 
reportative/hearsay marker, indicating the speaker’s hearsay epistemic access to the 
folkloric information conveyed by the narrative. The examples of = mi + nin/nisha 
are ubiquitous in natural discourse61, and most verbal reports are introduced this way. 
However, in context such as (5.48) below, nin preserves its original ‘verb of speech’ 
semantics: 
(5.48)  
Yupa  -n    apaya… Kay    uno, dos,      shu    illa  -kpi    ni    -n 
count -3     man       P.DEM  one  two  one    lack -SWREF    say   -3 
‘The man counts.. ‘Here, one, two...one is missing’, [he] says.’

In (5.48), the status of nin as a content verb is confirmed by the fact that it is the only 
finite verb in the clause . However, in (5.46) and (5.47), where the embedded clauses 
are root clauses, both nisha and nin function as complementisers.  In-depth study of 
the TK reportative/hearsay constructions and complement clauses with ni- could lead 
to interesting insights into the process of grammaticalisation in the language. 
However, i t falls beyond the scope of the present study.  Reportative constructions 
with nin were attested in other Quechuan varieties – in Imbabura Quechua, the ve rb 
co-occurs with the reportative marker -shi (cf. Cole 1982).  
In  (5.46) above, =mi occurs both in the embedded clauses, and in the matrix clause. 
Since =mi can only occur once per cl ause, this could suggest that the root speech 
complements in TK are embedded semantically, but not syntactically in the matrix 
clause. Complex sentences with embedded root clauses make not one, but two 
assertions (Hooper & Thompson 1973; cf. Faller 2014 for discussion with respect  to 
CQ). Consider:  
(5.49)  
a. She said the guests have just arrived.  
b. She said X 
c. The guests have just arrived  
                                                 
61 Of 2450 tokens of ni- in the ‘naturalistic’ corpus, 12% (n= 296) scope over =mi-marked clauses.

Utterance (5.49a) asserts both (5.49b) and (5.49c), where (5.49c) is not the assertion 
by the speaker, but rather a ‘cited/reported’ assertion of the subject of the embedded 
clause (Hooper & Thompson 1973, cited in Faller 2014) . This analysis is in line with 
the patterns attested in TK. The fact that the assertion i n the embedded speech 
complement and the assertion made in the matrix clause  are two separate assertions  
is evident in the context of self-corrections:  
(5.50)  
Muyu-ra  piti-w-n….  ima….  Coco....    
fruit-ACC  cut-PROG-3   what         coconut    
Mana,   [coco=mi          (a-n)          ]CP       ni- ni...          coco=chá... 
NEG      coconut=mi     (COP-3)                  say -1         coconut=cha 
‘He is cutting [harvesting] fruit….what…[It’s a] coconut…no, I said coconut, [is it a] 
coconut?’ 
el_24092014_03   003-5 
Example (5.50) is an excerpt from the description of the Pear Story video (Chafe 
1980). The speaker describes the video, identifying the fruit on the tree as a coconut. 
She then negates that previous opinion, presented in an embedded speech 
complement, and states that she is not convinced whether the fruit in the video is in 
fact a coconut. The embedded speech complement and the matrix clause are two 
different assertions, a s shown by the speaker’s use of different, mutually exclusive 
discourse enclitic in the two clauses. The embedded assertion is marked by =mi, 
while the matrix clause is a =cha-marked statement. This shows that while in the 
matrix clause the origo is the sp eaker of the utterance, in the embedded clause the 
origo shifts to the subject of the matrix clause. In  (5.50), both the speaker and the 
subject of the matrix verb correspond to the same person. The speaker quotes herself, 
since she no longer considers that the fruit in the video is a coconut, and therefore 
frames her previous statement in an embedded speech complement, merely 
presenting, rather than asserting, the =mi-marked proposition. The embedded speech 
complement can thus be interpreted as an assertion made by the speaker’s ‘former 
 
360 
 
self’. Similar analysis can be applied to self -correction complement clauses 
embedded the factive verb iya- (‘think’)62: 
(5.51)  
Chi       churiwa…..      ñuka   iyakani               churiwami....

el_21092014_02   069 
The complements of the verb of thinking can either be introduced by  nisha, or occur 
without a complementiser:

el_03102014_01   062 
The TK finite speech complements are always direct. This corroborates the analysis 
of embedded speech complements as  presenting the perspective/commitment of the 
subject of the embedded, rather than the matrix clause. Consider the examples below, 
coming from a narrative retelling of a ‘Tomato story’ picture stimulus (Skopeteas et 
al. 2006). In the story, a mother sends three children to the market to buy tomatoes, 
but only the youngest child succeeds. The examples below are excerpts from the 
story being told from the perspective of the external observer,  as in (5.53), and that 
of the youngest child, as in (5.54): 
 
                                                 
62 This construction is much less frequent than embedding under verbs of speech. Only 7 examples 
were attested in the 13h corpus.

In both cases, the speech comp lements are direct, as shown by the fact that they 
retain verb agreement used by the original speaker. In example  (5.53), it is also clear 
that the =mi in the embedded clause is indexed to the subject of the matrix clause.  
The examples above demonstrate that TK finite speech complements can be analysed 
in line with the analyses of embedded speech complements proposed by Krifka 
(2013; 2014) . He analyse s speech acts in terms of commitments they give rise to. 
Making a certain speech act brings on a certain commitment, e.g. making an 
assertion is characterised by ‘assertive commitment’ – being liable to the addressee 
 
362 
 
for the truth of the proposition (cf. Faller 2014: 52). However, in embedded speech 
complements it is not the speaker, but the subject of the matrix clause who is liable 
for the truth of the proposition, which is merely ‘presented’ by the speaker as 
someone else’s point of view. This is in line with Faller’s proposal according to 
which there is  a separate speech act of presenting, which differs from assertion 
(Faller 2002; 2012) . Nonetheless, there are important differences between the 
properties of d irect speech complements in TK and in CQ. As shown above, in TK 
speech complements the origo shifts to the subject of the matrix clause, which 
explains why finite speech complements  and their matrix clauses  can contain 
different discourse enclitics, including those which cannot co -occur within the same 
simple clause. This, together with the fact that speech complements are always direct, 
suggests that the TK direct speech complements embed semantically, but not 
syntactically. For CQ, Faller (2014) reaches the opposite conclusion. She remarks 
that the origo of embedded evidentials in CQ does not shift to the matrix subject, but 
remains with the speaker of the utterance context. This leads her to conclude that in 
CQ, finite speech complements embed syntactically, but not semantically.  
Another context in which the TK =mi can embed are finite complements of the non -
factive verb yachin (‘seem-3’). Consider:  
(5.55) = (5.19) 
 ñuka      yaya    shamu -w       =mi     yachi   -n 
[1SG       father  come  -PROG=mi  ]CP   seem    -3

his father to come home]

oh      fall     -ANT  -1=mi   seem    -3 
‘Oh, I seems I have fallen.’ [while drunk] 
el_18092014_01 57 
The consultants most often translate yachin into Spanish with constructions  
involving non-factive verbs: ‘it seems’ or ‘I believe’. In other dialects of Quechua, 
 
363 
 
the above utterances would not occur with =mi. In (5.55) the speaker bases his claim 
on incomplete evidence, and t herefore the inferential/conjectural evidential  or – in 
Cuzco Quechua – the marker -chus hina (see Section 5.3.1) would be appropr iate in 
this context. Example (5.56) is uttered in a context where the speaker is not fully 
aware of her  actions. Aikhenvald reports that in such contexts, evidential languages 
often recur to the use of indirect/non-visual evidentiality (2004: chap. 7). This is also 
the case for several Quechan varieties (cf. Weber 1986: 139; Faller 2002: 190) , 
where the reportative marker is used to mark the speaker’s unawareness of her o wn 
actions. In TK, either =mi + yachin or just yachin occur in those contexts .63 In 
general, =mi-marked propositions were able to embed under yachin in contexts 
where the speaker had partial/unreliable evidence for the embedded proposition. 
However, the typ e of evidence is not relevant. The construction was attested with 
conjectural/inferential evidence as in  (5.55), partial direct evidence, as in  (5.56), or 
reportative evidence from an unreliable source.   
The above shows that the embedding of =mi under yachin is not compatible with 
analysing the enclitic as a marker of certainty, direct evidence, or BPG. To use the 
latter, the speaker needs to believe in having the BPG (see Section  5.2.2.1), which is 
not the case if the proposition marked with =mi embeds under a weak epistemic 
modal. The examples above also show that =mi cannot be analysed in terms of ‘full 
epistemic support’ (cf. Boye 2012:  chap. 2) , since yachin encodes less -than full 
epistemic support. However, if =mi is analysed as marker of epistemic authority – 
‘the relative right to know or claim’ – it can be reconciled with embedding under 
yachin. 
As mentioned in the previous discussion (see Section  5.1.2), epistemic primacy and 
epistemic certainty belong to different dimensions of knowledge. Therefore, cases 
where the speaker has epistemic primacy over the information, but is not willing to 
assert it with certainty, though marginal, are logically possible.  
In (5.55) and (5.56) above the main point of both uttera nces is the embedded 
proposition (cf. Papafragou 2006; Krifka 2014) , with respect to which the speaker 
claims epistemic authority. Embedding the prop osition under a subjective epistemic

complements. 
 
364 
 
modal (Papafragou 2006)  indicates the speaker’s reduced commitment to the 
embedded proposition (Krifka 2014:14) . However,  it does not affect the speaker’s 
epistemic primacy. Utterance  (5.56)  was made in a context where the speaker was 
not fully aware of his actions, although, by virtue of being the actor, he does have 
epistemic authority over th em.  Example (5.55) can also be explained in this way – 
the speaker does have the epistemic authority to talk about his father and his comings 
and goings, since the father’s habits fall within the speakers’ ‘territory of 
information’. However, the speaker is not certain  whether it is indeed his father 
coming. Therefore, the embedding of =mi-marked claims under yachin could be seen 
as a strategy of ‘epistemic downgrading’ (Kärkkäinen 2003; Heritage & Raymond 
2005; Stivers et al.  2011).  
5.3.3.5 The semantics of =mi: a summary 
In the previous sections, I have shown that the TK =mi should be analysed as a 
marker of the speaker’s epistemic authority, understood as the ‘relative right to know 
or claim’ (Stivers et al.  2011: 13). The enclitic indicates that the origo’s authority 
over a given piece of information is superior to the authority of the other participant s 
of the interaction. Like other epistemic markers, =mi undergoes origo shift in 
interrogative clauses, where it is anchored not to the speaker, but to the addressee.  
The enclitic can be analysed as non -truth conditional, since it cannot be challenged 
or questioned. Its distribution is limited to declarative and interrogative clauses, 
while it cannot occur in imperative clauses. Nonetheless, its occurrence is possible in 
declarative clauses with mild hortative illocutionary force. The enclitic =mi scopes 
over certain propositional operators, such as negation, but does embed under the 
verbs of speech or thinking or under the weak epistemic modal yachin. In the first 
case, the =mi-marked embedded clauses mark perspective different from that of the 
speaker. In the second, use of the modal indicates the speaker’s reduced commitment 
to the =mi-marked proposition. According to recent literature (cf. e.g. Krifka 2014; 
Faller 2014; Woods 2016), the fact that =mi can embed does not necessarily preclude 
its analysis as an illocutionary  marker. I come back to the issue of whether =mi and 
=cha can be analysed as illocutionary in Section 5.3.5.  
The analysis of =mi developed in the sections above complements its analysis as a 
discourse enclitic ( Chapter 3 ) and focus marker ( Chapter 4 ), and does account for 
 
365 
 
some of its distributional properties, e.g. for the speaker’s choices to use =mi over 
=cha, or for its use in performative contexts. Ho wever, it still does not explain why, 
in the contexts with which it is semantically and functionally compatible, =mi is not 
obligatory in the TK discourse. I present further insights into the distribution of =mi 
(compares specifically with =tá) in Chapter 6.  
 The semantics of =cha: renouncing epistemic primacy 5.3.4
In this section, I focus on the enclitic =cha, which has been analysed as an 
conjectural/inferential (Weber 1986; Floyd 1997; Faller 2002)  or conjectural 
evidential (Faller 2007) in other Quechuan varieties. In Section  5.3.1, I have shown  
that this analysis does not app ly to the TK =cha. In the following sections, I show 
that the enclitic can be analysed as encoding both lack of epistemic primacy, and 
epistemic possibility. First, I discuss the contribution of =cha to the proposition 
expressed (5.3.4.1). Secondly, I discuss the occurrence of the enclitic in declarative 
(5.3.4.2) and interrogative clauses ( 5.3.4.3). I conclude with a brief summary of the 
marker’s semantics (5.3.4.4).  
5.3.4.1 =cha and the proposition expressed 
In Section  5.3.3.1, I discussed a range of tests used to determine the type of 
contribution a given linguistic element makes to the meaning of the utterance. The 
first two tests, the known truth/falsity test and the challengeability test, were used to 
determine whether a marker can be analysed as modal, and whether it encodes truth -
conditional meaning. The other two, the embeddability and interrogative scope test, 
were used in the literature to determine whether a marker can be analysed as 
illocutionary.  
The known truth/falsity test is used to distinguish between modal and non -modal 
markers. It relies on the assumption that modal markers are not felicitous if the 
speaker knows the truth value of the assertion (cf. Matthewson 2011). In the previous 
literature, the cognates of =cha were analysed as both evidentials and epistemic 
modals (Faller 2002; 2007) . In TK, =cha-marked utterances are very often used in 
requests for confirmation, which suggests that the speakers are not certain as to the 
truth-value of the =cha-marked propositions. Applying the known/truth falsity tests 
to the TK =cha is not a trivial task, however. As mentioned previously, the out -of-
 
366 
 
the-blue utterances marked with the enclitic are interpreted as questions. 
Consequently, presenting speakers with =cha-marked sentences and asking for 
evaluation of their truth-value is counter-intuitive and confusing, since interrogatives 
cannot be evaluated with respect to truth -or-falsity. As a result, eliciting truth value 
evaluations of interrogative utterances  would deliver unreliable data. Asking 
consultants whether they could use =cha to mark statements about the truth/falsity 
they are certain is also counterproductive, since asking about matters about the truth 
or falsity one knows is not a normal communicative practice.  
In naturalistic discourse, =cha tends to occur in polar questions which are requests 
for confirmation. In order to elicit confirmation, the speaker needs to entertain the 
proposition for which he seeks confirmation as a possibility. This, in turn, suggests 
that =cha does have an epistemic modal value. I explore this point in more detail in 
Section 5.3.4.2, where I discuss the differences in use of =cha and the 
polar/interrogative marker =chu.  
The second test, the aim of which is to check whether a given item can be a nalysed 
as truth -conditional, is the challengeability test. However, applying it to TK =cha 
poses the same problem as that described above. Only declarative utterances can be 
challenged or disagreed with, and when speakers are presented with =cha-marked 
utterances in elicitation contexts, they tend to interpret them as interrogative. 
Nonetheless, attempts to challenge =cha in a manner similar to that standardly 
employed in the challengeability tests are not felicitous: 
(5.57)  
A:  Kam-ba   kari  shuti   Pablo  =cha 
      2SG-GEN man name  NAME=cha 
B:    ?Mana,  kan  yacha-ngui=guti 
        NEG    2SG know-2=guti 
Q:  ‘Your husband’s name is Pablo/ Is your husband’s name Pablo?’ 
A:     ‘No, but you know it!’ 
elicited 
The utterance B in (5.57) was considered infelicitous by the speaker. However, the 
lack of felicity is not necessarily due to a misfire in challenging =cha. The exchange 
 
367 
 
was considered odd by the consultants. Speakers’ judgements about examples such 
as (5.57) are likely to be influenced by a range of pragmatic factors or conversational 
conventions, rather than only by the presence or absence of a given marker. 
Nonetheless, the corpus data and elicitation attempts suggest that =cha, like =mi, is 
non-challengeable and therefore can be considered non-truth conditional.  
The other two tests are related to the scope of the markers. The embeddability test 
determines whether the marker can be embedded under propositional operators. In 
the corpus of TK, =cha was not attested in any embedding contexts. Like =mi, it 
scopes over negation, and – unlike =mi – it does not embed under verbs of speech or 
thinking, or the modal verb yachin.  
The final test is the interrogative scope test, the aim of which is to verify  whether a 
marker can scope over illocutionary acts such as performing a request or asking a 
question. The enclitic =cha, like =mi, cannot occur in imperative clauses. As in the 
case of =mi, I interpret this co -occurrence restriction as showing that =cha is not 
compatible with the imperative clause type, rather than showing that it scopes under 
imperative marking. This conclusion is based on the fact that if =cha is analysed as a 
marker of renouncing epistemic authority, it can only occur in contexts where the 
origo is endowed with such authority. As discussed in Section  5.3.2, this is not the 
case in imperative clauses, which are associated with deontic, rather than epistemic 
authority of the origo.  
In sum, the tests described in this section suggest that =cha is a non-truth conditional, 
non-embeddable modal marker, only compatible with declarative and interrogative 
clauses. In Section 5.3.5, I come back to the scope properties of both =mi and =cha 
to discuss the level of meaning on which the markers operate.  
5.3.4.2 =cha in declarative clauses 
Out-of-the-blue =cha-marked utterances are always interpreted as interrogative (see 
Section 5.3.1). The enclitic only occurs in declaratives in connected discourse, where 
context shows that a given utterance is not a question to the addressee. Declaratives 
containing =cha are interpreted as dubitative statements or rhetorical questions:  
 
 
368 
 
(5.58)  
Usa=llara=cha           chi     maska-n, 
louse =ID.REF=cha   D.DEM  look.for -3 
ima=chari.      pariju-manda  maska-nu-sha                 tia-nun

‘It might also be lice that [she is] looking for, they both sit there looking [for lice] on 
each other.’ 
el_16082013_02   059 
In (5.58), the speaker narrates a video he has just watched, but has trouble 
interpreting the actions of the people shown in it. Thus, he uses =cha to show that he 
does not have epistemic primacy and is not willing to vouch for the validity of his 
conclusions. Utterance (5.59) also comes from re-telling a video:  
(5.59)  
Ukllarishka         washa     payna    makira  waktanawn, 
ukllari -shka       washa     payguna  maki -ta  wakta -nun

why        =cha   hit      -3PL    NEG   NEG    know  -1 
‘after embracing, they hit hands [hi-five], why do they hit, I don’t….don’t know.’  
el_16082013_01    152   
The speaker has seen people in the video preform the actions he describes, and 
therefore is entitled to epistemic primacy by virtue of direct access. However, he is 
unwilling to assume it and uses =cha, as well as  explicitly stating that he does not 
know why people in the video are behaving in the way they do.  
The occurrence of =cha on question words is characteristic for its use in declarative 
clauses, since in interrogatives the enclitic only occurs in polar question. One of such 
co-occurrences, imacha (‘what=cha’) is in the process of becoming lexicalised as a 
dubitative/rhetorical question particle ( see Section 3.3.2.7). The interrogative ima is 
also one of the most frequent hosts for =cha in the corpus. This could suggest that 
 
369 
 
=cha used to occur more often in declarative contexts. However, at present the 
marker is mostly attested in interrogative contexts, which I discuss in  the subsequent 
section. 
5.3.4.3 =cha in interrogative clauses 
As mentioned above, all = cha-marked utterances which do not occur in connected 
discourse are interpreted interrogatively. The fact that out-of-the-blue utterances 
marked with =cha are interpreted as interrogative has already been shown in Section 
5.3.1. Below, I repeat the example (5.16), used previously to illustrate that point:  
(5.60) = (5.16)  
a. #tamia-shka=cha 
   rain-ANT=cha  
 Intended: ‘It must have rained.’  [speaker has not seen the rain, but sees the 
 ground is wet] 
b. tamia-shka=cha? 
 rain-ANT=cha 
 ‘Has it rained?’  
el_18092014_01   02 
Out of context, the utterance of (5.60 a) is considered in felicitous. The enclitic =cha 
is also not the default marker used in conjectural or inferential contexts, where 
speakers prefer to use the =mi + yachin (=mi + seem-3, see Section 5.3.3.4), or just 
yachin (seem-3). When consulta nts were asked to watch a video recording of six 
three-shell games and guess where the seed has gone in each of them, they did not 
use =cha in their guesses, which would be the strategy employed in other dialects 
(Faller 2002; 2007) . Instead, they opted for =mi and/or yachin. In the ten minute 
recording (113 turns), the marker =cha did not occur at all.   
The above suggests that , as postulated previously, the TK =cha cannot be analysed 
as a conjectural evidential. However, its distribution can be accounted for if it is 
analysed as a marker of renouncing epistemic primacy  by the speaker, and possibly - 
although more data is needed  to corroborate this - as a marker attributing epistemic 
primacy to the interlocutor (see Section 6.3 for further discussion) . Such analysis 
 
370 
 
would explain why it tends to be interpreted as a request for confirmation. Making a 
conjecture does not necessarily invite the interlocutor to comment. However, 
signalling one’s lack of epistemic primacy is more likely to prompt the interlocutor 
to express their opinion. Consequently, analysing =cha as a marker of renouncing 
epistemic prim acy would explain why =cha-marked statements tend to receive an 
interrogative interpretation even in the absence of interrogative intonation, which is 
the key component of marking interrogative clause type in TK (see Section  5.3.2). 
Consider:  
(5.61)  
a. yaya     yachi-n,         pay-wa          yaya 
 father   seem -3    3SG -GEN      father 
 ‘[the] father, it seems, his father...’ 
el_18092014_02   28 
b. yaya    yachi   -n,     pay  -wa     yaya =cha   
 father  seem    -3     3SG -GEN     father=cha 
 ‘[the] father, it seems, is it his father (?)’ 
elicited  
While (5.61a) is a conjectural statement, (5.61b) is interpreted as a request for 
confirmation of the intuition that the individual  in question is in fact the person the 
speaker supposes he might be.  
As mentioned in Chapter 4, =cha is not the only TK enclitic which tends to occur in 
polar interrogatives. The polar question/negation marker =chu also occurs  in such 
contexts. While both enclitics occur on focal constituents, the data suggest that =chu 
is used in requests for information, while =cha tends to be used to elicit confirmation: 
(5.62)  
a. Kullki-ra  chari-ngui=chu ? 
 money-ACC have-2=Q/NEG 
         ‘Do you have money?’  
 
 
371 
 
b. Kullki-ra   chari-ngui=cha ?  
money-ACC  have-2     =cha 
‘So, do you have money?’ [we have agreed before that you were going to bring 
it] 
el_28052014_05 
Utterance (5.62a) is appropriate without any further context . Utterance (5.62 b), on 
the other hand, is felicitous if the interlocutors have previously agreed that the 
addressee was going to bring money, and the speaker is following up on the matter. 
Therefore, the meaning of =cha could be analysed as similar to that of English tag 
questions – the speaker assumes that the =cha-marked proposition is the case, but 
wants to give the addressee the option to negate it (cf. Krifka 2013: 10). The above 
shows that there is a parallel between the TK =cha and the South Conchucos 
Quechua marker of individual conjecture, -chri. In SCQ, -chri is used, similarly to 
=cha, to mark the speaker’s conjecture and el icit confirmation from the addressee 
(Hintz & Hintz 2014 : 11). However, as I show below, the occurrence of =cha is not 
limited to utterances based on conjectural evidence.  
The discussion above suggests that the difference between =cha and =chu lies in the 
level of epi stemic support encoded by each of the markers (cf. Boye 2012 , see 
Section 5.1.2). The use of =chu does not require the speaker to  commit to any 
evaluation of the epistemic possibility regarding the proposition. The marker could 
be analysed as ‘epistemically neutral’ (cf. Faller 2002: 166; Boye 2012: 66) and the 
=chu-marked propositions are simply added to the set of questions under discussion.  
On the basis on the current dat a, it is unclear whether =chu is simply neutral with 
respect to epistemic primacy, or whether it indicates that the epistemic primacy is not 
held either by the speaker, or the addressee. By making a =cha-marked utterance, on 
the other hand, the speaker mak es a conjecture, but also explicitly renounces 
epistemic primacy. This difference in the use of the two markers is apparent in  (5.63): 
 
(5.63)  
A:  Alli=cha  kasna-y=ga          ?  o... yapa  ashka=chu? 
 good=cha like.this-LOC=ga or very much=Q/NEG  
 ‘Would it [be] good like this? Or is it too much?’ 
 
372 
 
B:  Alli  =mi (…) 
 good=mi 
 ‘All good.’  
in_20092013    012-13 
In (5.63), two speakers talk about the food they are preparing. B has just taught A 
how to prepa re the dish, and A followed the instructions. She uses =cha in the first 
clause of her utterance to make sure that she has done it well. However, she does not 
have a notion of how much filling she should have used, and hence uses =chu in the 
second clause.  
In the discussion so far, I have been analysing =cha as encoding lack of epistemic 
primacy. Nonetheless, the examples given so far do not explicitly prove this analysis. 
The examples, as well as the discussion of the marker’s properties (Section  5.3.4.1), 
might suggest that =cha could be analysed as an interrogative marker encoding weak 
epistemic support, and only implicating lack of epistemic primacy. If the enclitic was 
a dubitative interrogative marker, it would be expected  to occur in all interrogative 
contexts. However, example (5.64) shows that this is not the case:  
(5.64)  
Context: conversation about a third person both interlocutors know equally well. 
a. Pay-wa   shuti   Pedru=chu ? 
          3SG-GEN name  NAME=Q/NEG 
   ‘Is his name Pedro?’  
b. *Pay-wa    shuti   Pedru   =cha    ? 
         3SG-GEN  name  NAME=cha 
         Intended: ‘Is his name Pedro?’  
elicited 
In (5.64), both interlocutors have equal epistemic primacy, sinc e they know the 
person who is the subject of the enquiry equally well. Therefore, the use of =cha is 
infelicitous, as shown in (5.64b). The opposite situation occurs in (5.65): 
 
 
373 
 
(5.65)  
Context:  Conversation about the addressee’s husband 
a. Kam-ba   kari  shuti  Pablo=cha  ? 
2SG-GEN man name NAME=cha 
         ‘Is your husband’s name Pablo?’            
b.  ?Kam-ba  kari  shuti  Pablo=chu ? 
 2SG-GEN man name NAME=Q/NEG 
 Intended : ‘Is your husband’s name Pablo?’  
elicited 
In (5.65), the subject of the conversation is the husband of the addressee and it is the 
addressee who holds the epistemic primacy. The =cha-marked utterance in (5.65) 
indexes the speaker’s  lack of epistemic primacy with regard to the subject matter. 
The =chu-marked utterance in (5.65 b) is judged odd, since it is neutral with respect 
to epistemic primacy *, and therefore fails to acknowledge that i n this case the 
authority laid with the addressee. Although at this stage this is only a hypothesis, this 
utterance might be dispreferred due to considerations related to politeness. Evidence 
to support or disprove this hypothesis could come from conversat ions between 
interlocutors who vary substantially in epistemic authority, e.g. a student and a 
teacher or parents and children. At this stage, not enough data is available to check 
the distribution of =chu and =cha in such contexts. 
In Section  5.3.3.1, I have discussed the occurrence of =mi in declarative and 
interrogative clauses, showing that it undergoes the ‘origo shift’. In declarative 
clauses, the marker was anchored to the speaker, and in interrogative clauses – to the 
addressee. The discussion of =cha shows that this enclitic does not undergo the origo 
shift. In both in declarative and interrogative clauses it is anchored to the speaker. At 
this stage, I am unable to provide an explanation for this property of =cha. 
Nonetheless, lack of origo shift is not unprecedented in epistemic marking systems 
across languages – certain markers in the evidential system of Tibetan also remain 
anchored to the speaker (Manuel Widmer, p.c. 17 March 2016).   
                                                 
* Note that research carried out after the defense of this thesis shows that when checked with a greater 
number of consultants (ca. 10), this intuition does not hold. The speakers judge both =cha and =chu 
equally permissible in both of the described situations. 
 
374 
 
In the discussion thus far, ther e has been little discussion about the sources of 
evidence which speakers have for making =cha-marked utterances. I have shown in 
Section 5.3.1 that =cha, unlike its cognates, is not felicitous in declaratives based on 
conjectural evidence. The examples below show that when speakers use the =cha-
marked interrogatives to elicit confirmation, their suppositions can be based on 
different types of indirect evidence: 
(5.66)  
Imasna=ra=y,   tamia-w-n=dza? 
What=ta=y  rain-PROG=cha 
‘What could it be, is it raining?’ 
el_25092014_01   009 
Utterance in (5.66) is based on inferential/conjectural evidence. The speaker is inside 
the house and hears noise, which sou nds like rain. He utters (5.66) to solicit 
confirmation about whether it is raining. Note that a =cha-marked declarative 
statement uttered in the same context, shown in  (5.60), was rejected as infelicitous. 
In (5.67), =cha occurs in an utterance based on pure conjecture. The speaker has 
seen the addressee’s husband borrowing a wheelbarrow from a neighbour, and she 
supposes he borrowed it to transport construction materials: 
(5.67)  
Tsatsa-ra  wasi      ra-nga=cha    asta-nga  ra-w-n    ? 
sand-ACC house     make-PURP=cha  load-FUT AUX-PROG-3 
‘He will load sand to make a house [won’t he]?’  
ev_24052013_01   015 
In (5.68), =cha occurs in an utterance based on reportative evidence. The speaker is 
requesting clar ification about a detail in the addressee’s life story, which the 
addressee has previously narrated:  
(5.68)  
kan     maybi-ra     riksi-ka-ngui,   kay-bi   o

‘Where did you meet [your husband], here, or [when] you went down to 
Limoncocha?’ 
in_13082014_01   078 
Examples of =cha on statements based on direct, clearly interpretable evidence were 
not attested in the elicited discourse corpus. As shown in Section 5.3.3.4, in cases 
where the speaker was a primary agent , but was not sure of her own actions, the 
preferred construction was =mi embedded under the weak epistemic modal.  
The non-occurrence of =cha in utterances based on direct evidence need not support 
its analysis as an inferential/conjectural  evidential. As mentioned above, =cha can 
only occur in conjectural questions, not in statements. Moreover, it is to be expected 
that a marker which encod es both lack of epistemic primacy  and weak epistemic 
support would not occur in utterances where the speaker is entitled to epistemic 
primacy by virtue of direct evidence for, or direct access to the information.  
5.3.4.4 The semantics of =cha: a summary 
In the se ctions above, I have discussed the meaning of the enclitic =cha. I have 
shown that, unlike its cognates from other Quechuan varieties, it does not encode a 
conjectural evidential meaning and that it should rather be analysed as encoding 
epistemic possibility and lack of epistemic primacy.  
The occurrence of =cha in unconnected discourse triggers an interrogative 
interpretation. Consequently, the enclitic is not readily evaluable by means of tests 
standardly applied to assess the truth -conditionality of epis temic markers. The 
patterns attested in discourse, as well as a tentative application of the challengeability 
test to =cha, suggests that it could be analysed as an epistemic modal, and as a non -
truth conditional marker. However, these results should be co rroborated by a wider 
array of tests, possibly ones designed specifically to analyse markers encoding 
meanings related to epistemic primacy. In particular, the impossibility of applying 
 
376 
 
the known/truth falsity test to TK =cha shows that more fine -grained t ools are 
needed to account for the properties of epistemic marking system in TK, and 
possibly related systems encountered cross-linguistically.  
The scope-related tests have shown that =cha does not occur in embedding contexts, 
and that, like =mi, it is un grammatical in imperative clauses. These properties 
suggest that =cha could be analysed as an illocutionary marker (see Section 5.3.5).  
Examples from both elicited and naturalistic discourse show that the marker occurs 
mostly in interrogative utterances, where it is used to elicit confirmation of the 
speaker’s prior intuition from the addressee. In this respect, it differs from the polar 
question/negation marker =chu, which is used to elicit information, and is neutral 
both in terms of epistemic possibility and epistemic primacy. In declarative clauses, 
=cha is used in rhetorical questions, which, taken out of the context of connected 
discourse, would also be interpreted as having an interrogative illocutionary force.  
 The TK epistemic primacy markers and the levels of meaning  5.3.5
In the previous sections, I have discussed the semantics of the enclitics =mi and 
=cha. I have shown that while they can both be analysed as non -truth conditional, 
they differ in their embedding properties . While =mi can be embedded under verbs 
of speech and thinking, and under the weak epistemic modal yachin (‘seem-3’), =cha 
does not occur in embedded contexts. Moreover, both markers are ungrammatical in 
imperative clauses, but can occur in declaratives and interrogatives.  
Quechuan evidentials have previously been analysed as non -truth conditional, 
illocutionary markers (cf. Faller 2002; 2007; 2014). Faller (2002) analyses the Cuzco 
Quechua =mi as an illocutionary modifier of sincerity conditions, encoding the 
speaker’s belief in having the best possible ground  for making a speech act . Under 
this analysis, in unmarked assertions the speaker’s belief in having the BPG is 
implicated, rather than encoded. Initially, Faller took non -embeddability as evidence 
for illocutionary status of evidential enclitics (Faller 2002). More recent research has 
shown that the CQ =mi can be embedded in finite speech complements (Faller 2014). 
However, recent studies have als o shown that in some contexts, illocutionary 
operators can be embedded (cf. Krifka 2014; Woods 2016) , which led Faller to 
 
377 
 
conclude that the illocutionary analyses of the CQ evidentials can be maintained. The 
CQ marker =cha, like =mi, was analysed as non -truth conditional, illocutionary 
modifier. Unlike =mi, =cha was shown to b e not only an evidential, but also an 
epistemic modal, operating on the illocutionary level (Faller 2007). 
The analysis cited above does not consider the fact that non -truth conditional 
meaning and restricted embeddability are compa tible not only with modification of 
illocutionary force, but also with modification of sentential force (cf. Portner 2006). 
Analysis of CQ evidentials as ‘sentential force specifiers’ rather than illocutionary 
modifiers was suggested by Portner (2006). In his view, illocutionary modification is 
pragmatic in nature, and consequently it should not be grammaticalised or expressed 
on the level of morphosyntax. He argued that modi fication which applies to the 
morphosyntax of the clause, operates on the level of sentential, rather tha n 
illocutionary force (cf. Portner 2006; Bruil 2014).  
The TK =mi lends itself well to the illocutionary modifier analysis analogous to that 
proposed by Faller (2002; 2014) . The enclitic modifies the ‘communicative 
intentions of the speaker’, which was shown most clearly in Section  5.3.3.2, where I 
discussed the illocutionary forces arising from the co -occurrence of =mi with 1st and 
2nd subject verbs. Although =mi only occurs in declarative and interrogative clauses, 
recent research has shown that illocutionary markers can be restrict ed to certain  
clause types (Coniglio & Zegrean 2012). In the case of =mi, the restriction related to 
clause-type can be explained by the fact that the epistemic authority meaning of =mi 
can only apply to clause types in which the ‘direction of fit’ is from the world to the 
words and, consequently, the authority of the origo is epistemic.  
Declarative clauses, even if they have directive illocutionary force, still constitute an 
update of the common ground, rather than an update of the to -do list (cf. Portner 
2006), and as such, can be reconciled with the notion of epistemic authority/primacy. 
Therefore, by uttering =mi-marked hortatives  discussed in Section  5.3.3.2, the 
speaker is expressing their opinion about how the world should be, but does not 
undertake an immediate attempt to change the world. Therefore, =mi could be 
analysed as an illocutionary modifier, encoding epistemic p rimacy of the speaker, 
which is otherwise implicated in declarative clauses. This analysis is analogous to the 
analysis of the CQ =mi as an illocutionary modifier of sincerity conditions encoding 
 
378 
 
BPG (cf. Faller 2002) . A similar analysis could be put forward for =cha. That 
enclitic could be analysed as an illocutionary modal marker (cf. Faller 2007) , 
encoding lack of the speaker’s epistemic prim acy, otherwise implicated in 
interrogative clauses.  
As mentioned above, other authors would argue that Quechuan discourse enclitics  
modify not only the speaker’s communicative intention, but also the morphosyntactic 
form of the clause, and as such should not be considered illocutionary (Portner 2006). 
If =mi was to be analysed as a modifier of clause type, or specifier of sentential force, 
it would require a more fine -grained analys is of TK clause types. The inventory 
would have to go beyond the three basic types described in Section 5.3.2, since the 
occurrence of =mi does not bring about a change that can be described in terms  of 
change between  interrogative/assertive/imperative sentential force.  The correl ation 
between clause type and oc currence of the marker can, on the other hand, be 
observed for =cha. Utterances  marked with the enclitic are interpreted as 
interrogative, unless this interpretation is neutralised by the discourse context.  
However, as mentioned above, it could also be argued that the interrogative 
interpretation of =cha-marked utterances is due to t he marker operating on the level 
of the illocutionary, and not sentential force.  
The discussion above shows t hat determining the level  of meaning on which th e TK 
epistemic authority markers affect the utterance is not a trivi al task. This 
complication is due in part to the vagueness of the notion of illocutionary 
modification. As remarked by Bergqvist (2015: 10), ‘ the concept of illocutionary 
modification remains vague with respect to what aspects of the speech-act are subject 
to modification ’. The discussion of the properties of =mi and =cha shows that 
individual markers within the same paradigm can vary in terms of embedding 
properties, or the nature of their interaction with clause type or illocutionary force of 
utterances. Markers with wide scope, and meaning related to intersubjectiv e aspects 
of the discourse context, are difficult to test in terms of how exactly their presence 
affects the content of the clause (Bergqvist 2015: 12).  
In sum, on the basis of the currently available data, it is difficult to establish whether 
the TK discourse enclitics modify the illocuti onary or sentential force of utterances. 
A more detailed analysis of these matters needs to be carried out in the future. The 
 
379 
 
issues with determining on which level of meaning the markers operate also points to 
the insufficiency of tests standardly applied to evidential or epistemic modal markers. 
This suggests that investigating a more complex range of epistemic meanings 
requires developing new tools, which could capture the fine -grained semantic and 
functional distinctions more accurately. It also shows that studying epistemic systems 
of under -described languages can teach us a lot about the range of semantic and 
functional distinctions conceptually available in the domain of epistemic perspective.  
 The semantics of other discourse enclitics 5.4
In the previous sections, I have focused on the cognates of Quechuan evidentials =mi 
and =cha. I have also briefly discussed the semantics of =chu, and how it contrasts 
with =cha, and have mentioned the partial overlap of the meaning of =mi and =tá.  
However, there are other markers with potentially epistemic meanings: =ma, =mari 
and =chari. The data currently available is not sufficient for a thorough analysis of 
these markers, but the aim of this section is to complement the information about the 
IS function of the mar kers discussed in Chapter 4  by providing the reader with a 
preliminary idea of the markers’ semantics.  
 Possible interpretation of =ma 5.4.1
As shown in the previous chapters, =ma shares distributional and information 
structural properties with the enclitic =mi: they both occur on clausal heads, and can 
mark information and contrastive foci. As far as the data show, in most contexts =mi 
and =ma occur in free variation. In elicitation contexts, when consultants were asked 
to translate sentences from Spanish, the have often volunteered clauses marked with 
=mi, but never with =ma, even if, when asked in the follow -up, they said that =ma 
would also be appropriate in the same context. When =mi or =ma occurred in 
naturalistic discourse, I ha ve often asked consultants in the process of transcription 
whether in a given context the markers could occur interchangeably. This was most 
often the case, and at this stage I am not able to make any conclusions about the 
contexts in which one of the mark ers was preferred over the other. The examination 
of these discourse contexts, and more targeted elicitation, should be one of the 
priorities in the future research on TK discourse enclitics.  
 
380 
 
The one context in which there is a clear discrepancy is embedd ing under the modal 
yachin (‘seem-3’). As described in Section  5.3.3.4, =mi embeds under the modal 
verb, but = ma was not attested in such contexts either in elicitation or in the 
naturalistic discourse corpus. Nonetheless, in t he entire naturalistic discourse corpus 
of 11 hours, the embedding of =mi under yachin was only attested 8 times. Given the 
overall lower frequency of =ma (see Section 3.3.2.3), this suggests that the 
conclusion that =ma is not embeddable under yachin would need to be confirmed by 
negative evidence. Although both markers can embed under verbs of speech, =ma 
only occurred six times, as opposed to 177 occurrences of =mi in the corpus.  
It has been proposed that dis course markers can vary in terms of whether they are 
related to subjective or objective sources of discourse coherence.  A relation of 
coherence is subjective if the speaker is engaged in creating it, either by reasoning or 
in pe rforming a speech act in one  or both segments connected by the marker 
(Sanders et al. 2016: 4) . An objective relation arises when the speaker is merely 
reporting the situation which takes place in the outside world (Sanders et al. 2016: 4). 
The subjective/objective contrast also does not help explicate the difference between 
=mi and =ma. Both markers occur in both types of contexts. Co nsider the example 
of a subjective construction below:  
(5.69)  
ñuka   rikukpi  mana  allima   sikanawshka… 
ñuka   riku-kpi  mana  alli=ma  sika   -nushka… 
1SG  see-SWREF NEG good=ma go.up-3PL.ANT 
‘According to me [the customs] have escalated [lit. gone up] the wrong way…’ 
KICHB07AGOPEDROCHIMBO1    333 
(5.70)  
Kallari   tiempo  ruku-wna  yacha-chi-shka   alli=mi. 
former  time  old-PL  known-CAUS-ANT  good=mi 
‘What the ancestors have taught [us was] good.’ 
KICHB07AGOPEDROCHIMBO1    558 
Both (5.69) and (5.70) are examples of subjective, eval uative predicates. In the 
corpus =mi and =ma can occur in both positive and negative polarity clauses.  
 
381 
 
In other varieties of Quechua, the cognates of =ma were analysed as either an 
emphatic version of =mi (Cole 1982: 170-1), as ‘impressive marker’ (Faller 2002), 
or as a marker of ‘confirmation of mutual knowledge’ (Hintz & Hintz 2014: 4) , that 
is ‘knowledge that both the speaker and the addressee have acquired firsthand and of 
which they are certain’ (Hintz & Hintz 2014:  10). The currently available data does 
not allow to convinci ngly resolve whether these analyses could also applied to TK. 
Moreover, it is not clear what the authors mentioned above meant by ‘emphasis’ or 
‘impression’. The emphatic interpretation does not seem to apply to TK, where 
utterances marked with =mi and =ma seem to have very similar emotive values. 
Also, unlike the Sihuas Quechua ‘confirmation of mutual knowledge marker,’ =ma 
can co-occur with future tense. On the basis of the data available at the moment, it is 
not clear what the properties of =ma are in in terrogatives, and whether its use with 
1st and 2nd person subjects gives rise to pragmatic effects similar to those described 
for =mi (see Section 5.3.3.2). The role of both markers in conditional clauses should 
also be explore d in more detail in the future. Potentially, investigating the 
distribution of =ma in the constructions listed above will shed some light on its 
semantics, and on how it contrasts with =mi. On the other hand, it is also plausible 
that the two markers vary along the lines of epistemic or intersubjective parameters 
which have so far not been considered relevant to the grammatical structure of TK.  
 Possible interpretations of =mari and =chari 5.4.2
The other two discourse markers which cannot be satisfactorily descr ibed on the 
basis of the available data are =mari and =chari. They have previously been 
analysed as emphatic equivalents of =mi and =cha, respectively. The distributional 
properties of the markers (see Chapter 3 ), and their role in focus marking (see 
Chapter 4) are sufficiently similar to warrant considering the ‘emphatic equivalent’ 
analysis for the TK markers. The fact that =mi and =mari, and =cha and =chari are 
judged as interchangeable in many discourse contexts suggests that =mari and 
=chari carry some sort of an epistemic meaning. It also appears that =mari, like =mi, 
undergoes origo shift in interrogative clauses:    
(5.71)

attested 
In (5.71), the speaker is narrating the Pear Story video as she watches it and realises 
that a boy who appears in the scene is not a son of another protagonist, but a thief 
who will steal his fruit. If =mari is an epistemic marker with a meaning related to 
that of =mi, in  this case it is clearly indexed to the speaker. Example (5.72) was 
uttered in the context of two women taking clo thes down from a laundry line. The 
speaker picked up a child’s skirt and looked at it from up close, unable to re cognise 
who it belongs to. Subsequently, she uttered (5.72) to the addressee, who is the aunt 
of the alleged owner of the skirt – a girl the speaker, too, knows very well. The 
problem with analysing =mari as an emphatic equivalent of =mi (as well as the =cha 
/=chari pair) is defining what ‘emphatic’ should stand for. In general, the utterances 
marked with =mi and =mari occur in similar communicative contexts, and it does 
not seem that the occurrence of =mari could be linked to t he speaker wanting to 
draw particular attention to the content of the utterance, or wishing to influence the 
addressee to a greater extent that a =mi-marked utterance would. Another 
interpretation of the TK =mari, hypothetical at this stage, is that it cou ld encode the 
speaker’s assumption that the addressee has failed to notice something that should be 
obvious. Such interpretation is suggested by many of the discourse contexts in which 
=mari occurs. A discourse marker encoding such a meaning was attested i n Kogi 
(Chibchan, Colombia, cf. Bergqvist 2016:  8) and further research should explore 
whether the TK =mari could be analysed in this way.  
In Section 5.3.3.1, I have me ntioned that the TK =mi is not plausibly related to 
existential closure. Examples (5.71) and (5.72) show that =mari can occur in clauses 
both with and without existential closure. However, future re search should examine 
how the actualisation of events relates to the use of =chari. In the elicited discourse 
corpus =chari most often occurs with the interrogative particle ima (‘what’). This 
 
383 
 
collocation seems to have become lexicalised as a hypothetical/ dubitative/irrealis 
marker, which often co-occurs in the same clause with another instance of =chari: 
(5.73)  
Shu   warmi  pay-wa         pani-ra=chari,    ima=chari        
one   woman  3SG -GEN      sister.of.male-ACC=chari     what =chari 
chi-ta          salura-nga   -sha        pakta-mu-n              
D.DEM-ACC   greet-PURP-COR   arrive -CIS-3      
‘A woman, [possibly] to his sister or someone else, [she] arrives to greet [the two 
man sitting in the video frame].’ 
el_16082013_01    067 
Example (5.73) was translated into Spanish in the subjunctive mood. This was the 
case for all the other =chari-marked clauses in the corpus, even in the absence of a 
conditional construction or the FUT/irrealis marker -nga, as shown in the example 
above. Although translation is not sufficient evidence for the validity of this 
interpretation of =chari, future research should look into the relation between the 
marker and existential closure. The possible epistemic and intersubjective meaning 
of =chari also remains to be explored in more detail.  
 Summary: epistemic authority marking in TK 5.5
Over the course of this chapter, I have discussed the notion of evidentiality, 
highlighted the issues pertinent to defining it, and mentioned how it has been related 
to other semantic domains in the literature. I have also shown that the TK enclitics 
=mi and =cha should be analysed as markers related to the origo’s epistemic primacy. 
More specifically, the  =mi can be analysed as encoding the origo’s epistemic 
authority, whereas =cha encodes the speaker’s lack thereof. While =mi undergoes 
origo shift in interrogative clauses, =cha is always anchored to the speaker. Both 
markers only occur in declarative and interrogative clauses, and are ungrammatical 
with imperative marking.  The meaning of both enclitics contribute s to the clause is 
non-truth conditional, and whilst =mi does not pattern like a modal, =cha seems to 
encode a weak epistemic modal value. The enclitic =mi can embed under verbs of 
speech and thinking, as well as un der a weak epistemic modal yachin (‘seem-3’), 
 
384 
 
whereas =cha does not occur in embedding contexts. It is unclear whether the 
markers contribute to the meaning of the clause on the level of illocutionary or 
sentential force. While =mi seems to interact more with the illocutionary force of the 
clause, the occurrence of =cha always leads to an interrogative interpretation of the 
utterance, which could suggest that the marker could be seen as operating on the 
level of sentential force.  
Apart from =mi and =cha, I have also briefly discussed other discourse markers. I 
have shown that =chu occurs in certain contexts in which =cha could also be 
expected, but that it seems to be epistemically and modally neutral. The verum focus 
enclitic =tá also indexes the speaker’s  epistemic primacy, and in some contexts it 
can be used interchangeably with =mi. In  Chapter 6 , I show that the difference 
between these markers can be accounted for if the speaker’s expectation of hearer’s 
knowledge is taken i nto account. I have also briefly discussed the markers =ma, 
=mari and =chari. While the first two seem to encode meanings somehow related to 
the epistemic primacy meaning of =mi, the enclitic =chari is more akin to =cha. The 
details of their semantics remain to be explored in future research.

 Common Ground management: a shared Chapter 6
   task of Information Structure and  
   epistemic marking   
In the previous chapters , I have identified the paradigm of TK discourse enclitics, 
and discussed their role in marking i nformation structure and epistemic primacy. In 
this chapter, I focus on those aspects of the meaning of the enclitics which go beyond 
their IS-marking functions and epistemic primacy semantics.   
I begin by following up on the discussion of the distributio nal properties of TK 
discourse enclitic from previous chapters. Thus far in the thesis, I have pointed to 
several factors which might influence the distribution of the TK markers, such as the 
information structural role of their host, or the origo’s episte mic authority over the 
information conveyed. However, even if all the considerations discussed in the 
previous chapters are taken into account, it is still far from clear why the TK 
discourse enclitics only occur in a relatively small percentage of utteran ces in the 
corpus. In Section 6.1, I propose that the distribution of at least some markers can be 
accounted for to a fuller extent if we consider expectation as one of its conditioning 
factors.  
Secondly, I show how the two aspects of the meaning of the TK discourse enclitics – 
marking epistemic primacy and marking IS categories – can be seen as having the 
same communicative function. I explain that both IS marking and epistemic primacy 
marking are strategies used to manage Com mon Ground (CG) in the process of 
communication (Chapter 6). Thirdly, I show how the emergence of meanings related 
to CG management which derive  from evidential meaning s is in line with cross -
linguistically attested processes o f grammaticalisation and semantic change  (6.3). 
Consequently, I briefly present a proposal of how marking of CG management can 
be situated with respect to the epistemic marking systems attested in other languages 
(6.4). Finally, I provide a short summary of the chapter (6.5).  
 
386 
 
 Accounting for the distribution of discourse enclitics: the 6.1
relevance of expectation 
In previous chapters , I have discussed the different distribut ional properties of the 
TK discourse enclitics. I have mentioned that they are not syntactically obligatory. I 
have shown that they only occur on phrasal heads (see Chapter 3), and – with the 
exception of =chu – in declarative and interrogative clauses (Chapter 5). In Chapter 
4, I have shown that the occurrence of the different discourse markers correlates with 
IS categories of focus, topic, or background.  In Chapter 5, I have explained in which 
discourse contexts, involving distribution of information between speech act 
participants, certain markers are chosen over the others. However, thus far I have not 
accounted for why the markers are absent in so many contexts where they would be 
syntactically and semantically appropriate in the light of the previous discussion.  
In this section, I show that the distribution of some of the TK discourse markers can 
be accounted for more accu rately if the factor of expectation is taken into 
consideration. In the probability -theoretical sense, expectation, or expected value , is 
the predicted value of a variable, calculated as the sum of all possible values each 
multiplied by the probability of its occurrence (cf. Merin & Nikolaeva 2008) . By 
analogy, a discourse participants’ expectation as to how communication will develop 
is tantamount to a development they judge the most probable in a given situation ; 
this is in light of the information they have access to, and their general knowledge 
about the world.  
In the literature to date, expectation has been considered relevant to the marking of 
(contrastive) foci (cf. Zimmermann 2008; Matić 2015) . Zimmermann (2008: 348)  
defines contrastivity as related to the fact that a particular focal information is 
‘unexpected for the hearer from the speaker’s perspective ’. The more unexpected the 
content is for th e hearer, the more likely the speaker is to use special grammatical 
marking. This observation is relevant to the use of discourse markers in TK. As 
discussed in Chapter 4, =mi surfaces most often in contrastive constructions, b ut is 
not limited to the cases where clear alternatives are present in discourse contexts. In 
the paragraphs that follow I show that in order to account for the distribution of =mi, 
the speaker’s assumptions about what the hearer considers likely or unlike ly need to 
 
387 
 
be taken into account (cf. Zimmermann 2008: 348). This property of =mi becomes 
particularly evident when it is contrasted with the verum focus marker =tá. 
Conversely to =mi, =tá tends to occur in contexts where the speaker assumes that the 
assertion he is making is in line with the expectations of the hearer.  
In Chapter 4 , it was demonstrated that several enclitics are associated with focal 
content in TK. In Chapter 5 , I concentrated on the semantic differences between 
them. I have shown that the choice between =mi and =cha in declaratives amounts to 
the difference in the epistemic authority the speaker holds – or wishes to project – 
over the information conveyed. On the other h and, the distributional difference 
between the verum focus =tá and information/contrastive focus =mi cannot be 
reduced to a difference in epistemic authority, which lies with the speaker in both 
cases. However, the two markers can be distinguished along th e lines of whether the 
speaker judges the content of their utterance as expected or unexpected to the hearer. 
Consider:  
 = (4.52)  (6.1)
A:  kam-ba   warmi   may-bi=ra              [a-n] ? 
 2SG-GEN woman  where-LOC=ta      [be-3] 
 ‘Where is your wife?’ 
B:  wasi-y=mi            /  *wasi-y=rá 
 house-LOC=mi    /    house-LOC=tá 
 ‘[She is] at home.’ 
A:  wasi-y=cha ?  
 where-LOC=cha 
 ‘At home?’ 
B: wasi-y=rá  ! 
          house-LOC=tá 
 ‘Yes, [she IS] at home!’ 
el_28112014_05  
As discussed in  Section 4.5.2, for =tá to be felicitous, the proposition needs to be 
textually evoked in prior discourse, that is, introduced into the set of questions under 
 
388 
 
discussion. No such requirement exists for =mi. In B ’s first utterance in  (6.1), =mi, 
but not =tá is felicitous: B is not expecting A to have a notion of where his wife 
might be. When the proposition that B’s wife is at home is introduced and A asks for 
confirmation, B responds with =tá. At this stage in the conversation, B can already 
assume that A expects that B’s wife is at home. Nonetheless, whether or not the 
proposition belongs to questions under discussion does not seem to be sufficient to 
determine whether it can be marked with =mi or =tá. Consider: 
  (6.2)
Q:  Riku-ngui=chu ? 
 see   -2    =Q/NEG 
 ‘Do you see [them]?’  
a. Ari,  riku-ni=mi /  Ari,   riku-ni=rá 
yes see-1  =mi  /  yes  see-1=tá 
‘Yes, I see. / I DO see.’  
b. Mana  riku-ni=mi. /  *Mana  riku-ni=rá 
NEG see-1   =mi / *NEG  see-1=tá 
‘I don’t see.’/ *‘I DO NOT see.’ 
el_28112014_05 
The exchange in (6.2) could occur in the context of two people watching the road, 
and one of them seeing two people approaching on a motorbike. The current question 
under d iscussion is introduced by the interrogative utterance. The affirmative and 
negative answers are alternatives which can be incorporated into the CG when the 
question is resolved. I propose that the choice between =mi and =tá in the examples 
above is related to whether the speaker assumes the hearer expects a given response. 
If they do, the proposition is marked by =tá. If they do not, it is marked by =mi. The 
felicity of both enclitics in (6.2 a) is due to the fact that it is ult imately down to the 
speaker to evaluate their interlocutors’ state of mind, and in certain contexts, this 
evaluation cannot be predicted on the basis of situational and/or discourse context. 
For now, I will leave aside the ungrammaticality of =tá in negative polarity clauses, 
 
389 
 
and will focus on the expectation -based explanation for the distribution of =mi and 
=tá.  
The enclitic =tá was not grammatical in the answer to the content question in (6.1) 
above, but it was grammatical in  the answer to the polar question in  (6.2a), which I 
have justified by stipulating that to occur with =tá, a proposition needs to belong to 
the set of Questions under Discussion (henceforth QUD) . Matić (2015) proposes a 
framework of modelling ex pectations in discourse, which also takes into account 
how the information is related to Q UD. In the paragraphs below, I briefly introduce 
the categories proposed by Matić (2015), and show how they contribute to explaining 
the distribution of =mi and =tá in TK discourse. 
Matić (2015) incorporates expectation into the relev ance-theoretical model of 
communication. While all utterances convey propositions, only the propositions that 
carry most relevance are asserted, updating the CG, and the update can only occur in 
the activated part of CG (henceforth aCG). The aCG, or communicative context, is 
created by propositions which are less relevant than the asserted ones. Those context-
creating propositions also determine the set of QUD. Every point in discourse evokes 
possible answers to the current QUD, which can be expected or unexpected in 
relation to the current aCG. Moreover, the questions in the QUD evoke expectations 
with different degrees of specifici ty. The degrees of specificity translate into 
different types of specification required for the ensuing utterance to be informa tive – 
the type of specification corresponds to the part of the proposition which is not given 
in the current aCG. Matić (2015: 3) distinguishes three kinds of expectation and four 
types of specification: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
390 
 
Figure 6.1 Types of expectation and specification 
Three types of expectations 
1. ENTAILED & EXPECTED – an eventuality is entailed by the QUD/aCG and as such expected 
2. PLAUSIBLE & POSSIBLE  – an eventuality is plausible in the given QUD/aCG and as such  
           possible 
3. UNDERSPECIFIED             –  an eventuality is unrelated to/underspecified as to the QUD/aCG 
Four types of specification 
A. FULLY SPECIFIED        – an eventuality is fully defined/given (whole proposition in  
                domain restriction) 
B. PARTIALLY SPECIFIED – an eventuality minus one element is defined/given 
C. TYPE-SPECIFIED           – the type of the eventuality is defined/given 
D. UNSPECIFIED 
Possible combinations: 1B, 1C, 1D; 2A, 2C; 3D 
Matić (2015: 3) 
The possible combinations of  the type of expectation with type of specif ication are 
restricted, as shown below the tables in  Figure 6.1. If an Entailed & Expected (E&E) 
event was fully specified, asserting it would be uninformative. If events are Plausible 
& Possible (P&P) in the light  of the aCG, they cannot be unspecified, since 
unspecified events are compatible with anything, and not just the activated CG. On 
the other hand, they cannot be partially specified, since the same assertion cannot 
both identify an eventuality and assert it s existence (cf. Matić 2015: 4). The events 
underspecified with respect to aCG are only compatible with no specification at all.  
The type of specification influences the interpretation of a given clause, determining 
the scope of focus. In case of unspecified events, the whole cl ause is in the scope of 
focus. In type -specified events, the focus is on the predicate, and in partially 
specified events – on one of the arguments of the clause. Fully specified events are 
only compatible with verum focus constructions, where the only ass erted element of 
the clause is its polarity. As shown in Chapter 4, =tá is only compatible with verum 
focus constructions, that is, with fully specified events. From the set of possible 
combinations constructed by Mati ć (2015), it follows that fully specified events ca n 
only be of the P&P type, that is, they need to be plausible and possible in the light of 
the currently activated CG and with respect to QUD . Examples of =tá from the TK 
discourse corpus confirm that it only occurs in such contexts. Consider:  
 
391 
 
 = (4.47)  (6.3)
A: Apachijllara       pambana? 
 apa-chi-j=llara      pamba-na 
 bring-CAUS-AG.NMLZ=ID.REF   bury-INF 
 ‘[So] the midwife herself has to bury [the placenta]?’  
B: Apachijllara     pambanará  /   #pambanami 
 apa-chi-j=llara    pamba-na=tá /   pamba-na=mi 
 bring-CAUS-AG.NMLZ=ID.REF bury-INF=tá /    bury-INF=mi 
 ‘Yes, [she] does have to bury [it] herself.’ 
in_08102014_02   164-165 
In (6.3), A asks a confirmation question, and B confirms that the CG should d evelop 
in accordance with what is plausible and possible in this context.  This suggests that 
for =tá to be used felicitously , the proposition needs to be fully -specified, and the 
answer needs to be congruent with what the speaker thinks the addressee is expecting.   
In (6.3), the use of =mi is judged odd. Below, I show that this is due to the fact that 
for =mi to be used felicitously, the speaker needs to assume that the addressee is not 
expecting the proposition to be the case.  Unlike =tá, =mi is compatible with all the 
different specification/expectation combinations. However, it is only obligatory in 
propositions which convey an unexpected and unspecified event. The obligatoriness 
of =mi in such contexts is due to the fact tha t they are by default incongruent with 
the expectations of the addressee. A default example of an underspecified, 
unspecified utterance, in which the speaker asserts a proposition they think goes 
against the hearer’s expectation of how the CG should develo p, are contrastive focus 
constructions (Zimmermann 2008: 355). Consider:  
 = (4.61) = (4.41) (6.4)
mana  ñuka    ushi=chu,           ñuka   warmi=mi  / *warmi   / *warmi=rá 
NEG 1SG   daughter=Q/NEG  1SG  woman=mi / *woman / *woman=tá 
‘[She is] not my daughter, [she is] my wife.’ 
el_28112014_05 
 
392 
 
Utterance (6.4) was only accepted by the consultants if the second conjunct was  
marked by =mi. Other examples of the enclitic in corrective focus constructions were 
given in Section 4.5.1, where I have also shown that corrective foci are the only 
context in which =mi seems to be grammatically obligatory. This seems to confirm 
that =mi is required when the speaker assumes that the addressee is not going to 
consider the asserted proposition likely to become CG (cf. Zimmermann 2008: 55). 
Such a conclusion is further corroborated by the fact that =mi is required for the 
felicity of certain illocutionary acts, such as warning or encouragement ( see Section 
5.3.3.2). The sentences used to perform such acts can also vary in terms of 
specification. Consider: 
 = (5.34) = (2.80)  (6.5)
Juan,   pantalon-da  liki-ngui=mi 
NAME  trousers-ACC  rip  -2   =mi 
‘Juan, you’ll rip your trousers!’ 
el_31052013_1   388 
Example (6.5) could be uttered by a parent who sees his son climbing a tree. It 
conveys an underspecified, unspecified proposition ; the content of the utterance is 
unrelated to QUD or the current aCG. However, =mi-marked utterances can also be 
fully specified. Consider:    
  (6.6)
A: Mana   usha-ni 
 NEG  can-1 
 ‘I cannot (do this).’ 
B:     [kan]  usha-ngui=mi 
         [ 2SG]  can   -2    =mi 
 ‘[Yes, you] can!’ 
attested 
In (6.6) above, I was stating that I will not be able to make a traditional drink, and 
my interlocutor was convincing me that I could perform the t ask. In the utterance of 
B the speaker asserts a Plausible & Possible, fully specified event. The focus of the 
 
393 
 
assertion is on the polarity on the clause, since A has previously asserted not being 
able to perform the task. However, if A expected that she w ill be able to perform the 
task in question and B merely wanted to encourage her fu rther, (6.7), and not 
utterance B from (6.6), would be felicitous:  
  (6.7)
Usha-ngui=rá ! 
can-2=tá 
‘You can [do this]!’ 
elicited 
Hence, the only difference between (6.6B) and (6.7) is how the speaker perceives the 
expectations of the hearer. The examples above show that =mi is obligatory in 
utterances which are by default unexpected to the hearer  (underspecified, 
unspecified). In utterances of all the other types listed in  Figure 6.1, =mi can be used 
if the speaker assumes that, despite the event be ing expected/plausible/possible with 
respect to QUD and the aCG, the addressee does not judge it plausible. In such cases, 
the decision to use =tá, =mi, or to make an unmarked utterance depends on the 
speaker’s subjective assessment of whether the hearer expects a given assertion. This 
explains why in  (6.2), repeated below, the positive answer is compatible with both 
=mi and =tá: 
 = (6.2) (6.8)
Q:  Riku-ngui=chu? 
 see   -2    =Q/NEG 
     ‘Do you see [them]?’  
a. Ari,  riku-ni=mi /  Ari,   riku-ni=rá 
yes see-1  =mi  /  yes  see-1=tá 
‘Yes, I see / Yes, I DO see.’  
b. Mana  riku-ni=mi. /  *Mana  riku-ni=rá 
NEG see-1   =mi / *NEG  see-1=tá 
‘I don’t see.’/ *‘I DO NOT see.’ 
el_28112014_05 
 
394 
 
In (6.8), one interlocutor is asking the other whether he se es the people who are 
passing by. While the analysis presented above can account for the occurrence both 
of =mi and =tá in the positive answer (6.8a), the negative (6.8b) is more problematic. 
I have mentioned previously that =tá does not occur in negative polarity clauses. In 
case of (6.8), it could be argued that in asking a positive polarity question speaker A 
is presupposing a positive answer, and therefore the negativ e answer is incongruent 
with his expectations. However, this hypothesis cannot be corroborated on the basis 
of currently available data.  
More research is needed into the occurrence of =mi and =tá in answers to negative 
polarity questions, as well as into the role of expectation in the occurrences of =mi in 
interrogative clauses ( see Section  The semantics of  =mi: claiming epistemic 
authority). The currently available data do not suffice to account for this aspect of the 
meaning of the enclitics. Future studies of expectation and related phenomena, both 
in TK and cross-linguistically, require setting up elicitation tasks which would allow 
studying elaborate distinctions in the inter -personal aspects of the context (cf. 
Zimmermann 2008).  
The analysis of =mi and =tá as contrasting with respect to the speaker’s evaluation 
of the hearer’s expectation complements other aspects of the markers’ semantics. It is 
compatible with their association with focus, as well as with their interpretation as 
markers of epistemic authority. The counter -expectation element of the semantics of 
=mi shows that the epistemic primacy  it encodes is associated exclusively with the 
origo. As mentioned in Section  5.3.3, in Cuzco Quechua (QII), =mi tends to be used 
when the speaker anticipates a challenge (Faller 2002). This observation also applies 
to TK, where =mi-marked utterances are considered ‘stronger’ tha n the unmarked 
ones. This aspect of the pragmatics of =mi also relates to its counter -expectation 
meaning. If the speaker assumes the addressee does not expect their assertion, then 
they are likely to anticipate being challenged (cf. Fetzer & Oishi 2014) . The enclitic 
=tá, on the other hand, encodes  the origo’s epistemic authority over information 
which the interlocutor was expecting. As such, the epistemic authority it encodes is 
shared between the discourse participants. The expectation  and specification 
distinctions proposed by Matić (2015) help explain the distribution of the markers by 
specifying discourse contexts in which both enclitics are felicitous. In the case of =tá, 
 
395 
 
Matić’s parameters corroborate the verum focus analysis of the marker. In case of 
=mi, the expectation/specification analysis delimits the discourse contexts in  which 
the marker is obligatory, and those in which it is optional. This is an important step 
towards providing a more complete account for the distribution of =mi in TK 
discourse.   
Considering the speaker’s assumptions about the hearer’s expectations as relevant to 
the distribution of TK discourse markers seems to be a promising line of research, 
and it should be spelled out in more detail in subsequent studies of TK. Further 
research is needed to verify whether it could also be fruitfully applied to encl itics 
other than =mi and =tá. 
6.2 CG management: epistemic perspective and Information 
Structure 
The paradigm of TK discourse enclitics was identified in Chapter 3, on the basis of 
the fact that all its members  perform discourse -related functions, and occur in the 
same morphological slot. The fact that the meaning of the enclitics described in this 
thesis is related to both Information Structure (see Chapter 4) and epistemic authority 
(see Chapter 5 ) might lead to a conclusion that the markers form a ‘notionally 
incoherent morphosyntactic system’ (Boye 2012: ch. 2) – a paradigm in which the 
different markers belong to different semantic categories and/or have unrelated 
functions. However, the paradigm of TK discourse enclitics can be analysed as 
notionally coherent if they are  analysed as encoding meanings facilitating the 
management of Common Ground. In this section, I propose that the marking of IS 
categories and marking of epistemic authority are related aspects of CG management.  
Common Ground constantly evolves in the proc ess of communication (see Chapter 
4). For communication to be effective, the discourse participants need to keep track 
of the CG content and to make sure their communicative goals are being met. The  
primary function of IS is to manage changes in CG, indicating how it should develop 
(Krifka 2007). In the scholarship on IS, the speaker’s assumptions, including those 
related to identifiability and activation of referents, have a recognised role in 
contributing to pragmatic structuring of propositions (cf. e.g. Lambrecht 1994) . 
 
396 
 
However, the TK discourse enclitics are not obligatory in every clause in which 
topical or focal constituents can be identified. The ir distribution is also affected by 
other considerations related to the distribution of knowledge between discourse 
participants (see Chapter 5 ), or speaker’s assumptions about hearer’s expectations 
(see Section 6.1).  
As discussed in Chapter 4  and Chapter 5 , speakers use =mi not only to draw the 
addressee’s attention to the focal constituent in an utterance, but also to assert their 
epistemic primacy, thereby highlighting information as congruent with their world 
knowledge. At the same time, the use of =mi indicates that the speaker considers the 
information as unexpected, and therefore potentially hard to assimilate for the 
addressee (see Sec tion 6.1). Consequently, the procedural meaning of =mi is to 
encourage the addressee to accept the =mi-marked information as part of CG, despite 
the misgivings they might have about it. The enclitic =tá achieves a similar effec t, 
although it is used in contexts where the speaker assumes that the addressee knows 
how the CG should develop. Conversely, =cha is not only associated with focal 
status of constituents, but also indicates that the speaker renounces authority over the 
information, leaving it to the interlocutor to provide further information that would 
warrant integrating the =cha-marked proposition into the CG. Consider the

in_20092013_01    186-87 
The exchange in (6.9) occurs in the context when another interlocutor has previously 
stated that the leaf is bitter, and therefore the question in this example can be 
interpreted as a request for confirmation. In  (6.10), on the other hand, the question 
follows up on another one by the same speaker, who doubted that the string will 
resist fire.  
The CG update made by utterances marked with the discourse enclitics exemplified 
above contains not only the pr oposition expressed, but also procedural information 
indicating how well the information is integrated with the worldview of the speaker. 
Being aware of this aspect of the information is relevant to CG management in that it 
delimits how communication can d evelop. If our interlocutor claims epistemic 
authority over a certain piece of information, challenging that belief would require a 
different conversational strategy to the one we might adopt if we are granted 
epistemic authority. Therefore, the use of =mi informs the addressee that the speaker 
considers the current question under discussion to be resolved. The use of =cha, on 
the other hand, indicates to the addressee that their next contribution is needed to 
resolve the question currently under discussion , and indicates what information it 
should contain in order to be informative. By the same token, =mi and =tá indicate 
the differences in the suppositions of speaker and hearer. This ‘sets the scene for 
subsequent discourse moves’, making the exchange more  fluid (cf. Zimmermann 
2008: 354). A similar increase in fluidity  is achieved by the use of the marker s 
=cha/=chu, both of which indicate that the question under discussion is not resolved, 
which also indicates how the speaker wishes for the communication to proceed. 
Parallels between IS-marking and epistemic marking were acknowledged in previous 
literature. Kamio (1997: 3) pointed out a conceptual relation between the ‘Territories 
of Information’ and  IS, stating that they both relate to ‘the character of information 
expressed in natural language’. In the Quechuan  literature, Hintz and Hintz (2014) 
observed that ‘the inter -subjective nature of certain evidential systems’ (see Section  
 
398 
 
6.3) invites discussion of how evidentiality relates to CG. The varieties they describe 
exhibit evidential marking of ‘mutual’ and ‘exclusive’ knowledge, which leads them 
to consider ‘mutual knowledge’ as a separate grammatical category. A similar 
conclusion could be reached with respect to the marking of CG management in TK. I 
discuss this idea in more detail in Section 6.4.  
The analysis of the TK encliti cs as markers of CG management is also in line with , 
and more specific than,  their interpretation as discourse markers, that is, as markers 
which enhance discourse coherence  (cf. Schiffrin 1987:  49). The TK discourse 
enclitic allow the interlocutors to ‘jointly integrate forms, meaning and actions to  
make overall sense out of what is said’  (Degand 2016). Irrespective of whether their 
meaning is more epistemic, or more IS -related, the TK enclitics enhan ce the 
coherence of discourse by ‘preparing the scene for a swifter update of CG’ 
(Zimmermann 2008: 360). 
6.3 From evidentials to epistemic primacy markers: a case 
study of intersubjectification 
Throughout this thesis, I have discussed the TK discou rse markers =mi and =cha in 
the context of their cognates from other Quechuan varieties. While I analysed the TK 
=mi and =cha as markers of epistemic primacy, in most Quechuan languages their 
cognates are analysed as evidentials. In the previous chapters, I have given examples 
from naturalistic and elicited TK discourse, in order to show that the analysis of the 
two markers as encoding epistemic primacy is justified. I have also provided some 
examples of synchronic variation, showing that the usage of the T K discourse 
markers differs from the usage of their cognates.  
In this section, I show that the semantic differences between the TK discourse 
markers and their cognates from other varieties can be analysed as an example of 
diachronic semantic change. Recen t research on grammaticalisation and semantic 
change (cf. e.g. Bybee et al. 1994; Mushin 2001; Traugott & Dasher 2005; Traugott 
2010) shows that the shift from evidential to epistemic authority meaning is not only 
possible, but plausible, since it involves semantic change from subjective to 
intersubjective meaning.  
 
399 
 
I defined the notions of subjectivity and intersubjectivity in Chapter 5, but I repeat 
them here for the sake of clarity. Subjectivity is the marking of the locutionary 
agent’s perspective encoded in linguistic expressions (Lyons 1982:  102), while 
intersubjectivity is linguistic marking of the ‘speaker’s acknowledgement of, and 
attention to the addressee’ (Traugott 2010:  2). Those two notions are related to 
processes of se mantic change, namely ‘subjectification’ and ‘intersubjectification’. 
Subjectification is a process by means of which ‘lexical as well as grammatical items 
tend to go from describing events or states of affairs to expressing the speaker’s inner 
state’ (Gipper 2011:  11). Intersubjectification is a process of grammaticalisation 
which consists of gradual development of a subjective meaning into an 
intersubjective one, that is, into meaning which is centred on the addressee (cf. e.g. 
Bybee et al. 1994; Mushin 2001; Traugott & Dasher 2002; Traugott 2010) , or related 
to inter-personal distribution of knowledge.  
Evidentiality can be analysed as a subjective category, since evaluation of sources of 
evidence for a given proposition is part of the speaker’s own viewpoint with respect 
to the proposition expressed. Epistemic primacy is more intersubjective, since it is 
concerned with the origo’s right to know relative to th at of the interlocutor. 
Consequently, diachronic semantic change from marking evidentiality to marking 
epistemic authority could be analysed as a case of intersubjectification.  
Both subjectification and intersubjectification involve semantic reanalysis of  the 
markers or constructions, as they come to encode increasingly (inter)subjective 
meanings. In the process, meanings which at earlier stages of grammaticalisation 
were only pragmatically inferable in certain contexts, become encoded as part of the 
semantics of the marker (Traugott 2010). This is precisely the case of the Quechuan 
enclitic =mi. In varieties in which it is an evidential marker, in certain contexts, such 
as conveying well -assimilated general knowledge, the use of =mi implies that the 
speaker has authority over the information. In TK, epistemic authority has become 
the meaning encoded by the marker. The varieties in which the =mi has been 
analysed as evidential include Huánuco (Weber 1989) and Wanka (Floyd 1997), both 
spoken in Peru and belonging to the QI dialectal group, which is considered the 
‘most conservative’ and closest to proto -Quechua (see Sectio n 1.1). The evidential 
=mi is also attested in Cuzco Quechua (Faller 2002) , also spoken in Peru, and 
 
400 
 
belonging to the more conservative Q II subgroup, QIIC. TK, on the other hand, 
belongs to the QIIB subgroup, which is considered to have changed the most with 
respect to proto-Quechua. This suggests that in diachronic development of Quechuan 
languages, the evidential meaning of the enclitic i n question precedes the epistemic 
primacy meaning. 
As discussed in Section  6.1, the use of TK markers such as =mi or =tá requires the 
speaker to take the addressee’s perspective on the information conveyed into account, 
independently of the discourse context in which they occur. This shows that these 
discourse enclitics can be analysed as encoding truly i ntersubjective meanings. 
However, the currently available data suggests that  intersubjective meaning remains 
a pragmatic inference in the case of the marker =cha. Compare examples (6.11) and 
(6.12) below:  
 = (5.20) = (3.68) (6.11)

In (6.11), an older speaker is recallin g the name of a person she used to know when 
she was young. The excerpt comes from a conversation of the speaker with a much 
younger interviewer, who did not know the person in question. Therefore, in this 
context =cha signals the speaker’s lack of epistem ic authority, but carries no 
assumptions as to the state of knowledge of the interlocutor. In  (6.12), the speaker 
 
401 
 
uses =cha in an interrogative clause, asking the more experienced addressee how 
much filling to p ut in a traditional dish. In this context, the addressee has more 
epistemic authority than the speaker.  The contrast between the two examples 
suggests that the meaning incorporating the perspective of the addressee arises as a 
pragmatic inference. However, example (6.11) is exceptional with regard to other 
instances of =cha attested in the corpus. All the other examples of the marker cited 
in this thesis were uttered in context in which the marker could be interp reted as 
indicating both the lack of the epistemic primacy on the part of the speaker, and its  
attribution to the addressee. Moreover, in case of lack of further context, =cha-
marked utterances are interpreted as interrogatives, or requests for confirmation. This 
suggests that despite the example in (6.11) the marker could be analysed as 
intersubjective.  
The fact that the TK paradigm of discourse enclitics contains markers that vary with 
respect to the degree of (inter)subjectivity they encode is in line with patterns attested 
cross-linguistically in similar systems. Bergqvist (2015) mentions an increasing 
number of reports of epistemic marking systems which ‘operate side by side with, or 
instead of, evidentials, but which have both speech participants ’ epistemic 
perspectives as a primary focus’. Although the systems he described come from 
language families other than Quechuan, it has been discussed previously that in 
certain Quechuan dialects the evidential paradigms include the perspectives of both 
the speaker and the addressee (Howard 2012; Hintz & Hintz 2014 ). While these 
systems are labelled as ‘evidential’ by the authors of their descriptions, they are 
clearly intersubjective in nature, and concerned not only with the source of evidence, 
but also with the distribution of information between the participants of the speech 
situation. As mentioned previously, Hintz and Hintz (2014) discuss the ‘evidential’ 
systems of South Conchucos an d Sihuas Quechua varieties , which include  markers 
not only indicating the speaker’s source of information, but also signalling whether  
or not the information is shared between the discourse participants.  
Comparing the different systems attested in Quechuan languages, Hintz and Hintz 
(2014: 18-19) postulate that the different Quechuan evidential systems gradually 
develop more and more intersubjective meanings, and that the process of their 
intersubjectification can be divided into three stages. At the first stage, the evidential 
 
402 
 
systems allow for three choices: ‘assertion’, ‘conjecture’ and ‘reported’, all of which 
encode origo -centred, subjective meanings. This system is attested in many 
Quechuan varieties, including Cuzc o Quechua (e.g. Faller 2002). The second stage 
consists of an intersubjective development. Additional markers are introduced, 
indicating whether ‘assertion’ and ‘conj ecture’ are individual (centred on the origo) 
or mutual (arrived at jointly by both interlocutors). The semantics of the reportative 
marker remain unaffected. Such a five -value system is attested in South Conchuchos 
Quechua. In the third stage of intersubj ectification, the reportative splits into 
‘nonpersonal’ and ‘generalised’, resulting in a six -choice system. The ‘nonpersonal’ 
reportative marks reported information the speaker obtained from someone else, 
much like the ‘traditional’ Quechuan reportative e vidential. The ‘generalised’ 
reportative is used where the information is held in common by the members of the 
speech community (cf. Hintz & Hintz 2014 ). The six -choice evidential system is 
attested in Sihuas Quechua.  
Hintz and Hintz (2014: 19) further claim that intersubjective eviden tial systems can 
‘be susceptible to simplification over time’. They postulate a possible stage four in 
the development of Quechuan evidential systems, in which ‘certain markers fall into 
disuse’, but point out that particular forms might still be used with  a meaning 
traceable to prior stages of their development. They suggest this is the case for the 
Cuzco Quechua marker =ma, which Faller glosses as ‘surprise’ (e.g. 2002) and 
Cusihuamán (1976/2001) as ‘impressive’ or ‘emphatic’ (2014: 19-20). 
The grammaticalisation process postulated above suggests that in Quechuan 
languages with more developed inter subjective systems, ‘mutual knowledge’ can be 
considered a grammatical category (Hintz & Hintz 2014:  1). The authors understand 
‘mutual knowledge’ as being gradually co -constructed by the discourse participants 
in the process of communication, in line with what I have bee n referring to as 
‘common ground’ over the course of this dissertation. Hintz and Hintz (2014: 5) 
analyse the Quechuan evidentials as ‘ interactional devices for the packaging and 
negotiation of information in discourse ’. This conclusion is similar to the one I have 
reached in the discussion of the function of TK discourse enclitic in Section 6.1.  
Despite leading to similar insights about the function of evidential markers, the 
grammaticalisation process described above and the one I postulate for T K vary 
 
403 
 
substantially. The analysis of the TK discourse markers =mi and =cha as encoding 
the distribution of epistemic primacy rather than the source of evidence fit s with the 
direction of semantic change postulated for other Quechuan varieties. However, the 
shape of the TK paradigm of discourse enclitics differs from what Hintz and Hintz 
(2014) would predict. The first major difference is the absence of the reportative 
marker. As mentioned previously, TK is not the only Quechuan var iety without a 
dedicated marker of reported information – Imbabura Quechua is also attested to use 
periphrastic marking of reportative, rather than a dedicated marker (Cole 1982) . 
Secondly, while the process postul ated by Hintz and Hintz (2014) involves 
development of more fine -grained, intersubjective evidential meanings of the three 
‘original’ markers, the TK markers have undergone a semantic shift towards a 
different epistemic meaning altogether. Moreover, before conclusions can be reached 
about how t he TK paradigm has developed, a more fine -grained analysis of the 
markers =ma, =mari and =chari needs to be carried out.  
6.4 Typological implications: CG management and the 
epistemic perspective domain 
In Section  Chapter 6 , I sugg ested that the TK discourse markers form a paradigm 
dedicated to the management of Common Ground. Given that certain markers within 
the paradigm encode epistemic meanings, a question arises of whether and how the 
paradigm of ‘CG management’ fits into the e pistemic perspective domain discussed 
in Section 5.1.2. The functional domain of epistemic perspective encompasses 
grammatical categories which express meanings related to the relationship between 
the origo and the information,  and the distribution of information between the 
participants of discourse (Bergqvist 2015). The original structure of the domain as 
proposed by Bergqvist was sho wn in Figure 5.2 in Section 5.1.2. In proposing the 
structure of the epistemic perspective domain, Bergqvist (2015) ordered the 
categories within it with respect to the amount of intersubjectivity they encode. He 
also ordered the different categories with respect to their scopal properties based on 
Cinque’s (1999) hierarchy of functional projections. In Figure 6.2, I attempt to 
incorporate the category of CG management into the epistemic perspective domain. 
The changes to the original diagram are indicated in bold.

Adapted from Bergqvist (2015: 12) 
The tentative placement of CG management shown in  Figure 6.2 is not without its 
problems. Based on the semantics of the markers, it seems accur ate that CG 
management should be situated towards the top of the scale. In the previous chapters 
and in Section  6.1, I have shown that the TK CG -managing enclitics indicate 
knowledge (a)symmetry between discourse participants. The placement of CG 
management in Figure 6.2 follows these semantic considerations.  
This, however, led to placing a category associated with  certain information -
structural categories higher above illocutionary mod ality on the ‘scope’ scale, 
contrary to the view accepted in generative syntax that illocutionary force scopes 
over information structure (e.g. Rizzi 1982) . At present, I cannot account for this 
apparent contradiction.  
Bergqvist (2015) based the bottom -to-top ordering of the different sub -domains of 
epistemic perspective on the assumption that more intersubjective meanings 
correspond to a wider scope of linguistic expres sion of these meanings. This has 
been confirmed in the literature on grammaticalisation (Traugott 1995; 2003; 2010; 
2012; Traugott & Dasher 2002) , including grammaticali sation of discourse markers 
(Traugott 1995) and deictic elements, such as demonstratives (e.g. Kratochvíl 2011). 
Traugott (e.g. 2010) observes that subjectified elements tend to appear at the 
 
405 
 
periphery of the constituent or clause. This observation applies both to TK ‘CG 
management’ markers, and to evidentials in other Quechuan varieties (e.g. Muysken 
1995; Sánchez 2015, see Sections 4.3 and 4.2, respectively). 
Traugott (2010) claims that increasingly peripheral position of a linguistic element in 
the phrase or clause is a structural correlate of increasing grammaticalisation and 
intersubjectification. However, this rule does not apply to the intersubjectification of 
Quechuan evidentials into CG management markers, postulated in Section 6.3. In the 
varieties in which they can be analysed as evidentials, as w ell as in TK, where they 
mark distribution of epistemic authority, the markers occu r at the periphery of the 
phrase, and show distributional similarities (see Chapter 4 ). Whether or not the ir 
move to a more peripheral position does correlate with increased 
(inter)subjectification of Quechuan discourse markers could perhaps be established if 
the investigation encompassed a greater time -depth. To my knowledge, no such 
study has been conducted to date, and it is questionable whethe r in-depth historical 
analysis of the syntactic positon of Quechuan discourse markers could be conducted 
on the basis of the available data.  
As mentioned previously, Figure 6.2 predicts that the markers with the m ore-
intesubjective meaning should also have wider scope than the less (inter)subjective 
ones. According to Bergqvist (2015: 13 and references therein), markers of epistemic 
modality and evidentiality have a ‘relatively narrow’ scope, and ‘sometimes scope 
under negation’. He further claim s that egophoric marking systems have not been 
attested to scope under negation, and that modal particles and Complex Epistemic 
Perspective (CEP) markers have scope over all the other categories. In  Figure 6.2, I 
postulate placing CG management between illocutionary modality and CEP marking. 
It follows that the markers of CG management  should also scope over all the other 
categories. As shown in Section 5.3.3 with the example of =mi, this is not always the 
case. The marker does scope over negation and can be analysed as non -truth 
conditional, but it can embed under verbs of speech and thinking, and under the 
epistemic modal yachin. The Cuzco Quechua evidentials, on the other hand, can onl y 
be embedded under verbs of speech (Faller 2014). As mentioned in Secti on 6.3, in 
case of the TK =cha it is not yet clear whether it can be analysed as unquestionably 
intersubjective. If its meaning is in fact subjective, according to Figure 6.2 the 
 
406 
 
marker should be associated with a relatively narrow scope. Nonetheless, the TK 
=cha has not been att ested in embedded contexts. These discrepancies  between the 
(inter)subjective meaning and embedding properties of =mi and =cha seems to 
contradict the aforementi oned correlation of wide scope with intersubjective 
meanings.  
The positioning of the tentative category of ‘CG management’ also requires further 
research into how it interacts with other categories shown in  Figure 6.2. This related 
to another feature of the ‘epistemic perspective domain’ which needs to be spelled 
out, namely how its different sub -domains relate to one a nother. Bergqvist (2015) 
postulates that illocutionary/speaker -oriented modality (Bybee 1985) , representing 
speech acts through which the speaker aims to influence the actions of th e addressee, 
belongs to the domain of speaker -hearer links. At this stage, it is not clear how the 
two semantic domains: ‘speaker-hearer links’ and ‘(a)symmetry of knowledge’ relate 
to one another cross -linguistically or in TK. The TK discourse enclitics, with the 
exception of =chu, are ungrammatical in imperative contexts, which are a prime 
example of speaker-oriented modality. However, as discussed in Section 5.3.3.2, the 
enclitic =mi is compatible with mild hortative speech acts such as giving advice.  
It is also unclear how the CG management markers relate to the marking of Complex 
Epistemic Perspective’ (CEP). Bergqvist characterises CEP as a subtype of multiple 
perspective (cf. Evans 2005) , in which ‘one perspective [is] embedded in another’ 
(Bergqvist 2015: 6). As discussed in Section 5.3.3.4, =mi – and possibly =ma – can 
be embedded under verbs of speech and thinking. Such constructions are used to 
convey reports of other speakers’ utterances, but are also used in self-corrections:  
 = (5.50) (6.13)
Muyu-ra  piti-w-n….  ima….  Coco....    
fruit-ACC  cut-PROG-3   what         coconut

NEG      coconut=mi     (COP-3)                  say -1         coconut=cha 
‘He is cutting [harvesting] fruit….what…[It’s a] coconut…no, I said coconut, [is it a] 
coconut?’  
el_24092014_03   003-5 
 
407 
 
In (6.13), the speaker’s previous view on the type of fruit harvested in the Pear Story 
video is embedded in the utterance conveying her current opinion. As such, the 
example could be analysed as an instance of CEP.   
The TK discourse enclitics pattern simi larly to CEP markers described by Bergqvist 
(2015: 13) in that they are restricted to certain sentence -types, but seem to be 
compatible with a wide range of illocutionary forces. The same, however, could be 
said about Quechuan evidentials in the varieties with the three -way evidential 
distinction (e.g. Floyd 1997; Faller 2002) . These ambiguities suggest that the scope 
properties of the different types of epistemic perspective expressions should be 
evaluated more rigorously in future research, both c ross-linguistically and within 
individual languages. However, a detailed description of the scope of expressions 
encoding epistemic, intersubjective meaning requires reviewing the tests standardly 
used to determine scope properties of linguistic markers. T ests evaluating their truth-
or-falsity and challengeability often deliver questionable results, since intersubjective 
meanings are more readily described in terms of felicity or congruence with a given 
context, than in terms of grammaticality. Furthermore,  recent research has also 
shown embeddability of a linguistic item is not a sufficient proof that its meaning can 
be analysed as truth-conditional (e.g. Krifka 2014; Woods 2016).   
The discourse -semantic considerations presented abo ve need to be investigated in 
more detail before definite conclusions can be reached about where ‘CG 
management’ fits into the epistemic perspective domain. The relationships between 
the different sub -domains of epistemic perspective are also likely to be revised if 
marking of emerging epistemic categories such as stance (cf. e.g. Du Bois 2007)  or 
engagement (cf. e.g. Evans 2016; Bergqvist 2016)  is considered in the cross -
linguistic description of epistemic perspective.  
In sum, the TK markers of CG management functionally and semantically fit within 
the functional domain of epistemic perspective postulated by Bergqvist (2015). The 
data from TK also show that the domain is far from complete in the shape in which it 
was proposed originally. Nonetheless, determining the place of  CG management 
marking within the domain, as well as its relationship with other categories, is 
problematic. Many of the categories belonging to the domain are difficult to define, 
and not enough descriptive data for languages in which these systems are at tested is 
 
408 
 
available at the moment. Consequently , reaching cross -linguistically valid 
conclusions about the semantic and syntactic properties of the domain of epistemic 
perspective requires further research into lesser -known languages, with a particular 
emphasis on their epistemic marking systems.  
6.5 Summary: TK discourse enclitics and CG management 
In this chapter, I have discussed those aspects of the meaning of TK discourse 
enclitics which escape the classification of being associated with either Informatio n 
Structure or epistemic meanings. I have shown, on the example of the enclitics =mi 
and =tá, that at least these two enclitics encode the speaker’s assumptions about the 
hearer’s expectations. I have also suggested that the paradigm of TK discourse 
enclitics is a notionally coherent system, the main function of which can be 
characterised in terms of ‘management of Common Ground’.  
Subsequently, I suggested that the meaning encoded by the TK =mi - and possibly 
=cha - could be plausibly analysed as a result of semantic change from subjective 
evidential meaning towards intersubjective  meaning associated with epistemic 
authority. Finally, I put forward a tentative proposal of how the meanings encoded by 
the paradigm of TK discourse enclitics could be incorporat ed into the ‘domain of 
epistemic perspective’. 
The general objective of this chapter was to show that the different aspects of the 
meaning of TK discourse markers explored in the preceding chapters should be 
brought together in the analysis . Only when cons idering them jointly are we able to 
appreciate the complexity of the communicative functions fulfilled by the TK 
discourse enclitics described and analysed in this thesis.

 Summary and conclusions Chapter 7
In this thesis, I present a new analysis of Quechuan ‘evide ntial’ markers, showing 
that in Tena Kichwa, they mark not the source of evidence, but the origo’s epistemic 
primacy. I also situate the ‘evidential’ enclitics within the paradigm of TK discourse 
markers. This is a novel approach, since in previous studies  the enclitics have been 
discussed in isolation (e.g. Weber 1989; Floyd 1997; Faller 2002) , or in relation to 
the ‘topic’ marker =ga (e.g. Sánchez 2010). Discussing the ‘evidential’ enclitics in 
the context of the other markers belonging to the same morphosyntactic system 
provides a clearer picture of their function in discourse. Showing how the TK 
discourse markers function in natural language was the priority of this study. 
Consequently, I have combined corpus -based research with experimental 
methodology, using tasks where it  was possible to control for what information was 
shared between discourse participants. This approach has allowed to investigate the 
use of the markers in natural discourse, as well as to gain insight into psychological 
states of the speakers when they us ed the markers. Both these aspects have proven 
crucial for analysing the meaning and distribution of the TK ‘evidentials’.  
In this chapter, I make some closing remarks with respect to the research presented in 
the preceding chapters. First, I provide a brief summary of the main points of each of 
the chapters ( 7.1). Secondly, I present some conclusions ( 7.2) and sketch the 
contribution made by this work ( 7.3). Lastly, I p oint to issues related to the subject 
matter of this thesis, which in my opinion would benefit from further research (7.4).  
 Summary of the previous chapters 7.1
Chapter 1  was dedicated to setting the s tage for the following parts of the thesis. 
Firstly, I have discussed the Quechuan language family and its internal subdivision, 
pointing out the typologically interesting features of Tena Kichwa. Secondly, I have 
introduced the TK-speaking community of Na po, Ecuador. I have briefly introduced 
the Napo Runa culture, and have provided the most important sociolinguistic 
information regarding the current status and state of the language. Subsequently, I 
have introduced the rationale behind this research, and p resented my research 
 
410 
 
questions. Following on from that, I have described the process of data collection and 
outlined the structure and the content of the TK corpus.  
Chapter 2 was a sketch grammar of TK, coverin g the basics of its grammar, so as to 
acquaint readers with the structure of the language. I discussed the phonemic 
inventory and basic suprasegmental phonology, provided an inventory of TK word 
classes, as well as nominal and verbal derivation and inflect ion patterns. Following 
on from that, I provided some insight into basic clausal syntax, including word order 
and description of basic characteristics of subjects and objects. I have finished the 
chapter with a description of coordination and subordination constructions in TK.  
In Chapter 3, I focused on the class of TK enclitics. First, I defined notions pertinent 
to the subsequent analysis: those of discourse markers and clitics. Subsequently, I 
have proposed language-internal criteria for distinguishing affixes from clitics in TK. 
Following on from that, I described the morphosyntax of all the enclitics attested in 
the TK corpus, and proposed that, on the basis of their distribution in discourse, only 
nine out of fifteen encli tics should be included in the paradigm of TK discourse 
enclitics. I have also shown that these nine enclitics can be analysed as discourse 
markers.  
In Chapter 4, I introduced notions relevant to the study of Information Struc ture, and 
described the IS -function of all the enclitics forming the ‘discourse enclitic’ 
paradigm identified in the previous chapter. The results of this analysis have shown 
that the TK enclitic =ga, rather than being a marker of topicality, should be ana lysed 
as a marker of presupposed information. The other enclitics forming the paradigm all 
co-occurred with different types of focus constructions. It was also shown that while 
the enclitics coincide with IS categories, they generally are not obligatory fo r the 
grammaticality of given topic-focus articulations, which raised further questions as to 
what other factors condition their occurrence. 
Chapter 5 explored this issue with respect to the subset of enclitics which occur in 
focus constructions. I discussed the notion of evidentiality, and defined the context of 
related categories of epistemic meaning. I also introduced the notion of ‘epistemic 
primacy’, a dimension of knowledge associated with the origo’s relative right to have 
certain information. The main part of the chapter was devoted to the semantic 
 
411 
 
analysis of the enclitics =mi and =cha, which are analysed as evidential markers in 
other Quechuan varieties. I have shown that in TK, rather than encoding evid ential 
values, they encode the origo’s epistemic primacy or lack thereof, respectively. I 
have also briefly explored the possible epistemic meanings of other TK enclitics. 
Epistemic considerations allow predicting in which discourse contexts one of the 
‘focus-marking’ enclitics will be chosen over the other. However, the y fail to 
account for the non-occurrence of the clitics.  
Subsequently, in Chapter 6, I explored additional factors which might influence the 
(non-)occurrence of  TK enclitics in discourse. Drawing on the example s of the 
epistemic authority enclitic =mi associated with (contrastive) focus, and the verum 
focus enclitic =tá, I suggested that the factors which influence their distribution are 
the type of specification  provided by the utterance, and the speaker’s evaluation of 
how the hearer expects the discourse to develop. I have shown that if these are taken 
into account, it is possible to predict in which contexts both enclitics will or will not 
occur. I have also shown that the analysis of =mi and =cha as epistemic markers can 
be reconciled with their analysis as evidential markers in ‘more conservative’ 
Quechuan varieties, since the semantic change from evidential to epistemic authority 
meaning can be analysed as a  process of semantic change, namely, 
intersubjectificaton. Furthermore, I proposed that the underlying meaning of the TK 
discourse enclitics, irrespective of whether the meaning is associated more with 
information structural or epistemic considerations, is  the management of Common 
Ground. Following on from that, I have explored the relation of CG management -
marking with respect to other categories of epistemic meaning.  
 Conclusions 7.2
The findings of this thesis can be summarised in the following points:  
i. TK h as a paradigm of discourse enclitics dedicated to Common 
Ground management 
The said paradigm of discourse enclitics comprises nine members: =ga, =mi, =ma, 
=mari, =chu, =cha, =chari, =tá and =ta. They can be classified as discourse 
enclitics because of prom iscuous attachment and their discourse -related meanings. 
 
412 
 
Unlike ‘prototypical’ enclitics, they optionally affect the lexical stress -assignment of 
their hosts, with the exception of =tá, which comes with inherent stress. All the 
aforementioned enclitics occupy the same morphosyntactic slot, and their occurrence 
is restricted to phrasal heads. Despite the semantic differences between the markers, 
the paradigm can be analysed as notionally coherent, since the functions of all of its 
members are related to Common Ground management.  
However, it should be pointed out that while the overarching function of CG 
management functions as a source of semantic coherence of the markers, their 
association with the different categories of IS calls this uniformity into quest ion. 
Consequently, Table 7.1 presents the paradigm, while taking the differences in the 
IS-association into account.

Table 7.1 shows that there is clear discrepancy between the set of e ight clitics 
associated with focus, and the enclitic =ga, associated with topicality/ presupposed 
information. This suggests that increased notional coherence of the paradigm could 
be achieved by not considering =ga as member of the set.  
 
413 
 
ii. The TK ‘epistemic primacy’ enclitics correlate with, but do not mark, 
information structural categories. 
This observation is important and relevant due to the fact that it cont rasts with 
previous scholarship  which, for other Quechuan varieties, analysed the evidential 
enclitics and =ga as markers of focus and topicality, respectively. This view cannot 
be upheld in TK, due to low frequency of the markers, and their other distributional 
properties. All the enclitics listed above correlate with IS categories, but they do not 
mark them.  
As mentioned above, the enclitic  =ga occurs only on constituents encoding 
presupposed information, including topics and background. It is not grammatically 
obligatory, but seems to surface in contexts where the speaker wishes to mark the 
information as both salient and contrastive. All the other enclitics are associ ated with 
different types of focus structures, including information, contrastive and verum foci. 
They too, are not grammatically obligatory.  
iii. CG management involves both epistemic mean ings and association 
with information structure 
The enclitics  listed above encode a variety of epistemic meanings.  This thesis 
described, in particular, the meanings of =mi and =cha, which are cognates of the 
direct and inferential/conjectural evidentials from other Quechuan varieties. The 
remaining enclitics were given a preliminary description.  
 In TK. the enclitics  =mi and =tá, encode the origo’s epistemic primacy, and =cha 
encodes the speaker’s lack of epistemic primacy. The markers =ta and =chu seem to 
be epistemically neutral. In some contexts, =ma and =mari occur in free variation 
with =mi, which suggests that their meanings are related. The same obtains for 
=chari and =cha. The epistemic primacy semantics of =mi and =cha is likely to 
have developed diachronically, via intersubjectification, from evidential meanings 
attested in other Quechuan varieties.  
iv. Speaker expectation is relevant to CG-management marking 
While the above statement is far from new, and follows from the definition of CG, 
few studie s demonstrate how the different types of speaker expectations can 
influence the linguistic form of their utterance. This thesis demonstrates that , 
showing that the  expectations of the addressee with regard to the expectation s and 
 
414 
 
state of knowledge of the addressee influence the speaker ’s use - and choice - of 
discourse markers. This is exemplified with the discussion of =mi and =tá, but could 
possibly be applied to other makers from the paradigm. 
 
The TK enclitics =mi and =tá both encode epistemic primacy and participate in 
focus marking. However, they differ in terms of the speaker’s assessment of the 
hearer’s expectation. If the speaker considers that the addressee expects given 
information, they will use =tá. If the information is judged as unexpected to  the 
addressee, the speaker will use =mi.  
 
v. Situational and interpersonal context is important for the adequate 
descriptions of evidential/epistemic systems 
A general conclusion that emerges from these findings is that the meanings encoded 
by evidential an d epistemic marking systems are not reducible to just encoding 
source of evidence or epistemic evaluation of the prop osition. The speaker s’ choice 
of how to present themselves with respect to the information they convey is a 
complex and multi -faceted aspect of the act of communication. It can influence the 
interlocutors’ perception of the speaker, and the interlocutor’s evaluation of the 
information conveyed in the speaker’s utterance. Consequently, the choice of 
whether and how to use an evidential/epistem ic marker is rarely made solely on the 
grounds of the speaker’s evidence for, or epistemic evaluation of, the proposition 
expressed. The speakers’ concerns related to their positive and negative face , their 
position as an authority on the subject, and even  their social standing, might also be 
relevant to ‘evidential/epistemic practice’ (cf. Michael 2008). Therefore, it is to be 
expected that in making an evidentially or epistemically marked s tatement, the 
speaker pays particular attention to the expectations and psychological states of their 
interlocutors. Consequently, these aspects of the communicative situation need to be 
taken into account in the analysis of evidential and epistemic systems.  
It follows that the discourse enclitics can only be adequately studied on the basis of 
naturalistic data, possibly coupled with specially designed ‘interactive stimuli’ (cf. 
Lüpke 2009). In elicitation of translations and judgements, speakers are unlikely to 
be as emotionally and mentally invested in their statements as they would be in a real 
 
415 
 
communicative situation. This is especially true for systems which – like TK 
epistemic primacy marking – encode intersubjective meanings.  
 Contribution 7.3
This study makes a number of contributions to the linguistic  scholarship in general, 
and to the documentation and research on Quechuan languages in particular. In this 
section, I discuss the most important of those contributions, showing how they 
answer the research needs identified in the previous literature.  
Firstly, this thesis provides a comprehensive description of a Quechuan variety for 
which no detailed descriptions exist ed previously . For Lowland varieties closely 
related to TK, the only descriptive studies available to date have focused on their 
phonology (Orr 1975), and some aspects of semantics (Nuckolls 1993; 1996; 2012) . 
For TK, only a phonological description was available (O’Rourke & Swanson 2013). 
Therefore, the sketch grammar which forms a part of this thesis answers the need of 
a more thorough description of the language.  
By focusing on the class of TK enclitics, this study also adds to our knowledge of the 
properties of Quechuan enclitics. The meaning and functions of ‘evidential’ enclitics 
and the ‘topic’  enclitic =ga have been described for several Quechua varieties 
(cf .e.g. Weber 1989; Muysken 1995; Floyd 1997; Faller 2002; 2007; Muntendam 
2015; Sánchez 2010) . However, as far as I am aware, this study is the first 
description of Quechuan clitics which provides a detailed discussion of the class of 
these expressions, rather than focusing on its specific subset. In doing so, this thesis 
offers a new insight into how the Quechuan ‘evidentials’ relate to other ‘free 
enclitics’, and shows that the Quechuan evidential/epistemic paradigm might need to 
be delimited  more broadly in future research. This is in line with descriptions of 
Quechuan varieties in which more than the three ‘standard’ evidential markers 
(direct/indirect/reportative) were attested (cf. D.J. Hintz 2012; D.  Hintz 2012; Hintz 
& Hintz 2014; Howard 2012).  
This is also the first study of Quechuan languages which provides a detailed 
discussion of both the information structural function of the markers in question, and 
their evidential/epistemic semantics. Previous studies have focused either on the role 
 
416 
 
of the enclitics in marking Information Structure (e.g. Muysken 1995; Sánchez 2010; 
2015; Muntendam 2015), or on the descriptions of t heir semantics (e.g. Weber 1989; 
Nuckolls 1993; Floyd 1997; Faller 2002; Howard 2012).  
Studies which conceptualise Information Structure as related to management of 
Common Ground (e.g. Chafe 1994; Krifka 2007; Féry & Krifka 2008)  underline the 
fact that the psychological state of the speaker, and well as their consideration related 
to the psychological state of the hearer, play a role in IS marking. The same has been 
said about evidential and epistemic marking systems, particularly by the authors who 
approach these phenomena from an interactional perspective (cf. e.g. Michael 2008; 
Gipper 2011; Nuckolls & Michael 2012  and articles therein ; Bergqvist 2012; 2015). 
Although parallels between IS marking and epist emic marking systems have been 
vaguely acknowledged (cf. Faller 2007; Zimmermann 2008) , to my knowledge few, 
if any studies have attempted to elucidate the relationship between them. 
Consequently, the joint analysis of the IS-marking and epistemic marking functions 
of the TK discourse enclitics is a step towards filling a gap in our knowledge about 
how IS-related functions and epistemic/evidential meanings relate to one another.  
A detailed description of how the TK encl itics interact with IS categories also shows 
that on the basis of the TK data, some assumption about their IS function should be 
revisited. The TK data shows that although the enclitics correlate with IS categories 
such as topic and focus, they cannot be a nalysed as topic - of focus markers, since 
they are not obligatory for most of the topic -focus articulations. This demonstrates 
even more acutely that the IS -marking and epistemic functions of the Quechuan 
enclitics should not be analysed in isolation, sinc e such partial view cannot account 
for the enclitic’s distribution in discourse.  
This thesis also provides a new insight into the scholarship on evidentiality, both in 
Quechuan languages and cross-linguistically. On the basis of a corpus of naturalistic 
discourse data, it describes a system which encodes values related to epistemic 
primacy, but which seems to be diachronically related to evidential marking. This 
shows that TK does not exhibit a ‘prototypically’ Quechuan evidential system 
distinguishing bet ween direct, indirect and reported evidentiality. It also raises 
questions as to how such a system could have developed. Cross -linguistically, 
evidential expression have grammaticalised from a variety of sources, including 
 
417 
 
‘evidential strategies’ and perfe ct tenses (cf. e.g. Aikhenvald 2004) , as well as 
epistemic modals (cf. e.g. de Haan 1999) . The description of the TK epistemic 
primacy markers shows a possible diachronic path of development of evidentials into 
epistemic primacy markers via the process of intersubjectivisation (e.g. Traugott & 
Dasher 2002; Traugott 2012) . A si milar path of development, although leading to a 
different shape of the resulting paradigm, has also been suggested for some varieties 
of Peruvian Quechua (Hintz & Hintz 2014a).  
This study also suggests that epistemic primacy and information structure markers in 
TK can be treated jointly as CG-managing devices. This opens a question of whether 
epistemic or evidential systems in other (Quechuan) languages could also be 
described in these terms. Moreover, this thesis shows that the notion of expectation is 
potentially relevant not only to ma rking of information structure, but also to the 
description of epistemic marking systems (e.g. Bergqvist 2015) . The relevance of 
expectation to Information Structure has not been explored in detail in the current 
linguistic literature, but the findings from TK show that the expectation values of the 
TK epistemic markers are in line with expectation parameters relevant to IS marking 
in unrelated languages, such as Bura (Chadic , Zimmermann 2008)  or Tundra 
Yukaghir (isolate, N-E Siberia, Matić 2015).  
Lastly, this study contributes to the scholarship on discourse markers. The 
methodology of cross -linguistic work on disco urse markers is based on fine -grained 
monolingual analysis of their semantic, syntactic and pragmatic properties (cf. 
Visconti 2016). This study provides just that for a lesser -spoken language, for which 
no descriptions of discourse markers w ere previously available. It also raises a 
question of how data from lesser studied varieties can inform the development of 
cross-linguistically applicable catalogues of discourse relations and models of their 
annotation. 
 Avenues for future research 7.4
This thesis touched on many issues which, for reasons of space or availability of data, 
it could not explore in more detail. The minor issues which require further research 
 
418 
 
were highlighted over the course of the thesis. Here, I briefly outline these avenues 
for further research which I consider the most important.  
First and foremost, this thesis provides an initial description of the TK (discourse) 
enclitics, but it does not give an exhaustive account of their semantics and use in 
discourse. This is true partic ularly for the enclitics =ma, =chu, =chari and =mari. 
While the morphosyntactic distribution of the markers was described in considerable 
detail, the description of their epistemic meanings requires further data collection and 
analysis. Future investigatio n should focus in particular on whether they too can be 
described as related to epistemic primacy, and how and whether their use is 
conditioned by the distribution of knowledge between discourse participants. The 
latter seems especially relevant in the lig ht of the recent descriptions of the ‘non -
standard’ evidential systems in other Quechuan varieties (cf. Hintz & Hintz 2014 ). 
The description of TK discourse enclitic would also benefit from more insight into 
how the clitics relate to other aspects of the TK grammar, e.g. it remains to be 
explored how discourse enclitics interact with conditional constructions in TK, and 
how their occurrence relates to constructions used to describe actualised and non -
actualised events. Further research is also needed into TK in general and of TK 
discourse e nclitics in particular. The description of the TK information structure 
would also be more thorough if it included an analysis of prosodic strategies used in 
the marking of IS categories. An aspect of the meaning of TK enclitics which was 
not considered in this study, and which would greatly enhance our understanding of 
the paradigm, is whether and how the use of the enclitics relates to politeness.  
Investigating the issues suggested would benefit from collecting new types of data . 
The current corpus conta ins a variety of genres, and constitutes a relatively accurate 
snapshot of the TK community life. However, it lacks data  which would allow 
insight into language acquisition, and acquisition of epistemic enclitics in particular. 
Children’s speech, interacti ons of parents and children, or interactions of teachers 
and students are possible sources of such data. Collecting these types of data is an 
especially pressing task, given that intergenerational transmission into TK is likely to 
break down in the near future. Moreover, as the language becomes less and less used 
in the communities, the speakers’ pragmatic competence is likely to diminish (cf. 
Weber 1989: 402-3).  
 
419 
 
More diverse data is also needed to investigate the  TK enclitics which were not 
described in  great detail  this study , including =ma, =mari and =chari. This task 
requires developing new ways to collect data on discourse/epistemic markers (see 
Chapter 5). In particular, new elicitation methods need to be devised, allowing th e 
researchers to track intersubjective aspects of the speech situation, including the 
distribution of knowledge, but also other aspects related to social cognition (cf. San 
Roque et al. 2012: 2). Developing such tools should be one of the priorities of future 
research into the discourse markers in TK, and cross -linguistically. Another avenue 
which could be pursued is developing  a protocol for annotation of knowledge states 
of the participants of discourse, which would allow for more sophisticated 
knowledge tracking. Multi -level annotation of discourse (cf. Gast 2016)  could 
potentially give researchers more insight into the semantic distinctions encoded by 
epistemic markers. This would be of partic ular importance to research on these 
domains of epistemic meanings which were only recently granted more attention, 
including multiple perspective (e.g. Evans 2005; Zariquiey 2015) , stance (e.g. 
Mushin 2001; Du Bois 2007), or engagement (e.g. Bergqvist 2016; Evans 2016).  
Collecting the different types of data mentioned above should also be coupled with 
different approaches to data analysis. Studying language as a communicative 
sequence, and incorporating methods from discourse analysis, could be beneficial for 
our understanding of discourse markers. Quantitative analysis could help complete 
the picture, allowing an insight into dependencies which might remain invisible from 
the point of view of qualitative research.

Appendix 1 TK conversation (el_25092014_01) 
This appendix contains  a transcription of a five -minute conversation between two 
speakers, nian1 and jach1. Both are male, native speakers of TK, bilingual in Spanish, 
and were respectively 29 and 34 years old at the moment of the recording. The topic 
of the conversation is the  Pear Story video (Chafe 1980), which the participants are 
watching as they speak. While nian1 has seen it about 10 times already, jach1 has 
just finished watching it for the first time seconds before this co nversation started. 
The code of the speaker and reference number for each utterance are given in the line 
below the translation. The turns in which I participate in the conversation have been 
excluded from this transcript. The audio and video recordings of  the conversation are 
available in the TK deposit in the ELAN archive, in the bundle ‘el_25092014_01’.
