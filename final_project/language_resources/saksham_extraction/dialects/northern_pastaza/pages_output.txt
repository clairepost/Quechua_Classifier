ABSTRACT 
The Attributive Suffix in Pastaza Kichwa 
 
Barrett Wilson Hamp 
Department of Linguistics, BYU 
Master of Arts 
 
This thesis is a corpus-based description of the attributive suffix -k in Pastaza Kichwa, a 
Quechuan language spoken in lowland Amazonian Ecuador. The goal of this work is, first, to 
describe the behaviors, characteristics, and functions of the suffix using data from the Corpus of 
Pastaza Kichwa (Rice 2018a), and second, to offer a typological analysis of these behaviors in 
order to identify the most appropriate classification for the suffix. The suffix has previously been 
described as a nominalizer (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming), and the equivalent suffix in 
other Quechuan varieties has been described as an agentive nominal relativizer (Weber 1983; 
Weber 1989; Cole 1985; Lefebvre & Muysken 1988) or a participle (Markham 1864; Weber 
1989; Guardia Mayorga 1973; Catta Quelen 1985; Debenbach-Salazar Saenz 1993, Muysken 
1994). This work claims that the function of the -k suffix in Pastaza Kichwa more closely 
conforms to crosslinguistic descriptions of active participial functions. 
 
After introducing Pastaza Kichwa and the -k suffix, I use numerous examples to describe 
the behavior of the suffix. The data is taken from the Corpus of Pastaza Kichwa, which is 
composed of 40 narrative texts and contains 32,127 tokens. 846 examples of the -k suffix are 
found in the corpus. Following the presentation of the data, I offer an analysis based on previous 
descriptions of nominalizations and participles in Quechuan languages, as well as typological 
descriptions of nominalizations and participles crosslinguistically. I rely chiefly on the 
typological description of participles found in Shagal (2017) to conclude that verb + -k forms 
function as active (or nominative) participles in Pastaza Kichwa.

Chapter 1: Introduction 
 
The purpose of this thesis is to describe the uses and grammatical characteristics of the 
attributive suffix -k in Pastaza Kichwa (PK). The primary goal of this study is to take inventory 
of the varied uses of the -k suffix and the environments in which it occurs using the Corpus of 
Pastaza Kichwa (CPK) (Rice 2018a). Secondarily, I will offer a typological analysis of the 
behavior of the -k suffix in PK, concluding that the function of the suffix is similar to active 
participial functions crosslinguistically. This discussion will be informed by previous analyses of 
the -k suffix in PK (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming) and analyses of agent noun suffixes in 
other Quechuan languages (Weber 1989; Cole 1985; Lefebvre & Muysken 1988). An in-depth 
description of the behavior and functions of the -k suffix in PK has not been previously 
undertaken. 
In this chapter I offer a sociolinguistic overview of PK and a basic description of the 
typology of PK and introduce the -k suffix. I discuss the literature surrounding the -k suffix and 
its equivalents in other varieties of Quechua. I also detail the CPK, its composition and 
preliminary findings concerning the -k suffix. In Chapter 2 I present the description of the -k 
suffix based on data from the CPK. In Chapter 3 I explore typological and theoretical 
explanations for the behavior of -k. Finally, in Chapter 4 I conclude and discuss shortcomings. 
 
1.1 Pastaza Kichwa 
 
2 
The Quechua language family is comprised of languages spoken throughout South 
America in the Andean regions ranging from southern Colombia to northern Argentina, as shown 
in figure 1. PK is a Quechua II language spoken in the Pastaza region of lowland Amazonian 
Ecuador. 
 
 
Figure 1: Map of Quechuan languages throughout South America 
(https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/quec1387) 
 
With over 10 million speakers, the Quechuan family has the highest number of speakers 
of any indigenous language in North or South America (Adelaar and Muysken 2004). Pastaza 
Kichwa (also known as Northern Pastaza Kichwa) [ISO-code: qvz] belongs to the Quechua II-B 
branch of the family. Figure 2 shows the genetic relationships in the Quechuan language family 
leading to PK. For a complete family tree, see Appendix 1.

Today there are approximately 10,000 speakers of PK with an estimated 300 monolingual 
speakers. PK is classified as threatened in both Glottolog and Ethnologue and classified as 
vulnerable according to the Endangered Languages Project (Lewis, Simon, and Fennig 2016). 
Typologically, PK exhibits fairly typical Quechuan morphosyntactic properties. It has 
nominative-accusative alignment. The basic word order is SOV, though in many situations there 
seems to be free variation with SVO. PK employs a switch-reference system. Morphologically, 
PK is a highly agglutinating, suffixing language. Unlike many of the Peruvian varieties of 
Quechua described in the literature, PK lacks a full paradigm of personal reference markers used 
4 
on nouns to express possession and on verbs to indicate direct object agreement. The loss of 
these in PK is perhaps due to influence from the Barbacoan languages that were spoken 
throughout Ecuador when Quechua was first introduced (Gijn 2016). Muysken (2000: 985) 
posits that the morphological and phonological reductions found in Lowland Ecuadorian Kichwa 
varieties, when compared to Peruvian varieties, are possibly the result of a creolization that 
occurred after Spanish colonialization. 
 
1.2 The -k suffix 
 
The -k suffix in PK is described by Nuckolls & Swanson (forthcoming) as an attributive 
suffix. This attributive suffix is defined as a deverbal nominalization that “attributes a certain 
role, ability, activity, or characteristic trait to the subject of its verb” (Nuckolls & Swanson, 
forthcoming: 174). As a nominalizer the -k suffix is similar to the agent noun suffix -er in 
English. For example, English teach becomes teach-er (teach-AN) ‘one who teaches’. Similarly, 
in PK, yachachi-na (teach-INF) ‘to teach’ becomes yachachi-k (teach-SUF) ‘teacher’ or ‘one who 
teaches.’ However, Nuckolls & Swanson observe a number of non-agentive uses of the -k suffix, 
and therefore do not refer to the -k suffix as “agentive” (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 
180). 
Descriptions of other Quechan languages have generally analyzed equivalent suffixes as 
agentive nominalizers, though they have also been analyzed as active participles, habitual aspect 
markers, relative subordinators, and complementizers. A goal of this paper is to determine the 
most appropriate categorization of the -k suffix based on its behavior. Throughout this paper the -
5 
k suffix will be glossed SUF so as not to favor one analysis over another until a conclusion is 
made. 
Concerning the phonological representation of the suffix in the literature, the -k suffix in 
PK is generally represented as a voiceless velar stop [k], though it can allophonically be realized 
as a voiced velar stop [g] when followed by a voiced consonant (Nuckolls & Swanson, 
forthcoming: 176). The agent noun suffixes in a number of other Quechuan varieties are also 
described as [k] (Markham 1864; Coombs 1976; Catta Quelen 1985). In the Imbabura dialect 
described by Cole (1985), the equivalent suffix is realized as a voiceless velar fricative [x] which 
is represented in examples from the literature using the letter -j per Spanish orthography. In the 
Peruvian varieties, the agentive noun suffix is a voiceless uvular stop [q] and is represented in 
the orthography as such (Weber 1983; Weber 1989; Parker 1969; Lefebvre & Muysken 1988, 
etc.). It is reasonable to assume that historically these suffixes share a common source, likely the 
uvular [q], as the function is roughly the same in each variety, and the uvular consonants have 
been lost in the Ecuadorian varieties, becoming velar (Muysken 2000). 
Nuckolls & Swanson (forthcoming) is a pedagogical grammar of PK and is the only work 
to describe the -k suffix in PK, presenting the suffix’s forms and its four main functions. In 
addition to nominal functions, verb + -k forms are shown to function also as adnominal 
modifiers. It is also observed that verb + -k forms are used in a habitual aspect construction in 
which a verb + -k form is used with the verb ana ‘to be’ (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 
192). Also, Nuckolls & Swanson describe verb + -k forms functioning adverbially to modify a 
matrix verb in instances where the verb + -k form cannot be said to fill an argument of the matrix 
verb (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 208). In summary, a verb + -k form can function as a 
noun, as a modifier, as a habitual aspect marker, and as an adverb. A goal of chapter 2 will be to 
6 
examine these claims and compare them to data from the CPK in order to verify Nuckolls & 
Swanson’s characterization of the suffix. 
Looking outside of PK, there is a small literature on agentive nominals in other varieties 
of Quechua. Table 1 summarizes these sources. They are sorted first by the branch of the 
Quechuan language family in which each variety is found, in relation to PK. Since PK is a 
Quechua II-B (QII-B) language spoken in Ecuador, QII-B languages of Ecuador are listed first, 
followed by other QII-B languages. These are followed by QII-C languages of Peru and Bolivia, 
and finally QI languages. The name of the Quechuan variety and the source is given, as well as 
the phonological representation in each variety of the agent nominal suffix. Finally, a summary 
of the key analyses made in each source concerning the suffix is given.

To summarize, among Quechuan languages there is a suffix -k, -x, or -q (likely derived 
from proto *-q) that derives a noun or participle from a verb. It is classified as an agentive 
nominalizer in nearly all analyses. The resulting noun or participle refers to the agent or active 
participant of the verb and can function as a noun, a nominal relative, a habitual aspect marker, a 
verbal complement, and/or an adverb. Comparing Nuckolls & Swanson’s description of the -k 
suffix in PK to these descriptions, there are clear similarities, e.g., deverbal derivation, nominal 
functions, adnominal modifying functions, habitual aspect construction, adverb-like use. A goal 
of chapter 2 will be to examine these behaviors in greater detail, and to explore potential other 
uses of the suffix in PK not addressed by Nuckolls & Swanson, such as complementation. 
In order to fully characterize the -k suffix in PK I will use the Corpus of Pastaza Kichwa 
to take inventory of its uses and the environments in which it is found. This survey will be 
informed first by Nuckolls & Swanson’s description of the suffix. Then I will turn to the 
descriptions of other Quechuan languages to see how well, if at all, those descriptions match the 
behavior of the suffix in PK. 
 
1.3 The Corpus of Pastaza Kichwa 
 
The Corpus of Pastaza Kichwa (CPK) was created by Rice (2018a) and is composed of 
40 narrative texts totaling 32,127 words (tokens). The majority of the recorded narratives (29 out 
of 40) were collected by Dr. Janis B. Nuckolls (Brigham Young University) and are archived in 
9 
the Quechua Collection in the Archive of Indigenous Languages of Latin America (AILLA) at 
the University of Texas Austin. The remaining narratives (11 out of 40) were recorded by Dr. 
Tod D. Swanson (Arizona State University) who owns and operates a field school outside of 
Tena, Ecuador, where Kichwa language and culture is studied and taught. In each case, the texts 
were recorded and transcribed in handwritten notes that were then re-transcribed into digital 
format before creating the CPK. 
Rice’s motivation for creating the CPK was twofold: first, to facilitate the study of PK 
morphology and syntax, specifically switch reference (see Rice’s MA thesis Switch-Reference in 
Pastaza Kichwa, 2018b); and second, to show that the use of corpora in documentary linguistics 
can be a “fruitful endeavor” (Rice 2018b: 30). Using corpora, it is possible to analyze large 
amounts of data and to discover patterns that may have been less apparent or less intuitively 
observed. There are of course shortcomings to using corpora. With under-documented languages 
the available data, or lack thereof, can affect the validity and usefulness of a corpus. This risk can 
be mitigated in part by gathering data from a variety of sources on a variety of subjects. In the 
case of PK there was no digitized corpus before the CPK, leading Rice to build the corpus from 
the ground up. Rice chose to use narrative texts taken from recorded speech of a native speaker, 
Sra. Luisa Cadena. The advantage of using these narratives in creating the CPK is that they 
represent natural speech and cover a variety of subjects. A shortcoming is that the data is 
representative of only one speaker. 
Table 2 lists the complete set of narratives that make up the CPK, along with the name of 
the speaker, the name of the contributor who recorded the narrative, and the word count. They 
are sorted alphabetically according to the title. These works are cited throughout this paper by 
10 
their abbreviation following “CPK:”. For example, a sentence taken from the story “Adopting an 
anaconda” will be cited (CPK:ado).

1.3.1 Tagging and preliminary data 
 
In total there are 846 occurrences of the -k suffix in the CPK. Each of these was tagged 
by the author of this thesis for its morphological and syntactic characteristics, i.e., morphological 
co-occurrences and syntactic roles. Tables 3, 4, and 6 summarize the tags, criteria, and 
preliminary results of searches in the CPK, with examples. Included also in Table 5 is a summary 
of the PK enclitics that interact with verb + -k forms. These were not tagged but are presented 
here for completeness in describing the nominal and verbal morphology found to co-occur with 
the -k suffix. 
Morphologically, the -k suffix attaches to a verbal stem which can be composed of the 
verbal root and certain suffixes. Table 3 summarizes the verbal suffixes that were found to co-
occur with the -k suffix in the CPK

The -k suffix derives a deverbal noun, which means the resulting verb + -k form can take 
nominal morphology. Table 4 shows the nominal suffixes that co-occur with the -k suffix in the

Additionally, there are four enclitics that are found to interact with verb + -k forms in PK. 
These are -mi, -shi, -ga, and -chu. -mi is an evidential that indicates a statement made from the 
perspective of the speaker or self. -shi is an evidential that indicates a statement made from the 
perspective of an other. -ga is a topicalizer. And -chu is an irrealis marker used in negative 
constructions and yes/no questions. As clitics, these have greater freedom to attach to nouns, 
verbs, and other categories, which means their use with verb + -k forms tells us little about the 
category of the verb + -k form. However, it bears mentioning that there are interactions. Table 5 
shows how many times each enclitic was found to co-occur with a verb + -k form in the CPK.

Finally, each verb + -k form was tagged for the syntactic role it played in the phrase in 
which it was found. These roles and the criteria for determining them are based on Nuckolls & 
Swanson’s description of the suffix in PK and the descriptions found in the literature of agent 
noun suffixes that may be equivalent in other Quechuan varieties. These are described here and 
are summarized in Table 6. 
The nominal quality of verb + -k forms in the literature seems chiefly to be based on their 
ability to take nominal morphology (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 176; Lefebvre & 
Muysken 1988: 3; etc.). Additionally, verb + -k forms can serve as the argument of a verb, can be 
modified by nominal modifiers, such as adjectives, demonstratives, and relatives, and can stand 
alone in an NP. 
The key defining feature in determining if a verb + -k form is part of a habitual aspect 
construction is its collocation with a form of the verb ana ‘to be’ (Nuckolls & Swanson, 
forthcoming: 192; Weber 1989; Adelaar 1987: 32; Hurtado de Mendoza 2002: 92-93). All other 
cases where a verb + -k form is used with a verb, but is not an argument of the verb, are 
considered adverbial (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 208). 
16 
Though not described explicitly by Nuckolls & Swanson, but described throughout the 
literature, a verb + -k form that modifies a head noun, or one that has internal argument structure, 
such as a direct object marked with the accusative suffix -ta, is considered a relative clause, and 
specifically a nominalized relative, meaning a clause (with internal structure) that can function as 
a noun or modify a head noun (Weber 1983; Weber 1989; Cole 1985; Lefebvre & Muysken 
1988). Additionally, it is the case that in most of the literature that describes relative clauses in 
Quechuan languages, a verb + -k form that stands alone in an NP is analyzed as a relative clause 
without an overt head noun, and is considered a “headless relative” (Cole 1985: 175). This 
analysis would mean that all of those forms in the current study tagged NOM should likewise be 
tagged REL. At this stage, however, I have chosen to keep the tags separate so as to maintain a 
distinction between the two behaviors, i.e., noun-like vs. modifier-like, but with the 
understanding that further analysis will likely conflate these two categories. 
In the literature, a number of authors have referred to verb + -k forms as participles 
(Markham 1864; Weber 1989; Guardia Mayorga 1973; Catta Quelen 1985; Debenbach-Salazar 
Saenz 1993, Muysken 1994). The term “participle” can be difficult to define crosslinguistically, 
and not all of the authors in the Quechuan literature who use the term define it. In the absence of 
clear criteria in the Quechuan literature, I have chosen not to use participles as a tag; however, by 
the end of this thesis I hope to reach a better understanding of what participles are, especially in 
terms of the -k suffix in PK.

1.4 Summary 
 
In this chapter I have given a brief description of PK and the Quechuan language family. 
This set the stage for a discussion of the -k suffix in PK. I summarized the existing literature 
surrounding the suffix in PK and agent noun suffixes in other Quechuan varieties. I have also 
introduced the CPK and presented data preliminary to analyzing the suffix’s behavior. In the 
next chapter I present data from the CPK that exemplify the behavior of the -k suffix. 
  
18 
Chapter 2: Description 
 
In this chapter I present a description of the -k suffix in PK using data from the CPK. I 
begin by presenting the description of Nuckolls & Swanson (forthcoming), as it is the only 
description of the suffix in PK. Nuckolls & Swanson describe four behaviors of the suffix. First, 
definitionally the suffix derives a noun from a verb. Nuckolls & Swanson also observe the non-
agentive uses of the suffix, calling into question the accuracy of the term “agentive” in 
classifying this suffix. Second, a verb + -k form can modify another noun. Third, the suffix is 
used in a verbal habitual aspect construction with the verb ana ‘to be.’ Fourth, verb + -k forms 
can function adverbially to modify a non-copular verb. 
I supplement Nuckolls & Swanson’s description with other descriptions of agent nouns 
from the literature, as appropriate, in order to compare data from the CPK to their 
characterizations. Chiefly, I will look at Weber (1989), Cole (1985), and Lefebvre & Muysken 
(1988). Weber observes the non-agentivity of the “agentive” suffix in Huallaga Quechua. 
Additionally, Weber describes the suffix as a participle (Weber 1989: 284). Cole describes the 
agentive nominal in Imbabura Quechua as a relativizer and argues for “headless” relatives. Cole 
also argues that the suffix is part of a subordinate tense paradigm, marking present tense. 
Lefebvre & Muysken describe relative functions and complement functions of the suffix in 
Cusco Quechua. Additionally, Lefebvre & Muysken argue for a derivational version of the 
agentive suffix and an inflectional version in Cusco Quechua. 
Finally, I present data on the PK suffix -shka in order to determine if there is a 
relationship between it and the -k suffix. Throughout the literature the -k and -shka suffixes have 
been described as contrasting participles (Markham 1864; Coombs 1976; Catta Quelen 1985; 
19 
Debenbach-Salazar Saenz 1993) and contrasting nominalizers (Soto Ruiz 1976; Cole 1985; 
Lefebvre & Muysken 1988; Escribens 1970; Alderetes 2001). A comparison of the two suffixes, 
if it is found that they are of the same category, may inform our understanding of the -k suffix.  
 
2.1 Noun-like 
 
Nuckolls & Swanson introduces the -k suffix as being similar to the -er suffix of English, 
i.e., the agent noun marker. The suffix attaches to a verb root and the resulting derivation is a 
noun, being able to take nominal morphology, such as the plural, as seen in (1). 
 
(1) mandzha-na      → mandzha-k        → mandzha-k-guna 
fear-INF  fear-SUF  fear-SUF-PL 
‘to fear’  ‘fearer’  ‘fearers’ 
      (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 176) 
 
In the CPK, 38 verb + -k forms occur with the nominal plural -guna. A few examples are 
presented in (2). 
 
(2) apa-k-guna (take-SUF-PL) ‘takers’    (CPK:cha) 
ri-k-guna (go-SUF-PL) ‘goers’     (CPK:fin) 
shamu-k-guna (some-SUF-PL) ‘comers’   (CPK:per) 
shaya-k-guna (stand-SUF-PL) ‘standers’   (CPK:sui) 
wañu-k-guna (die-SUF-PL) ‘die-ers’    (CPK:thr) 
 
Verb + -k forms are also able to take case marking, including the accusative suffix -ta, the 
comitative -wan, and the ‘until’ suffix -gama (all properties of nouns), as in (3). 
20 
 
(3) yacha-k-guna-ta (know-SUF-PL-ACC) ‘knowers’ or ‘shamans’ (CPK:fin) 
puñu-k-guna-ta-shi (sleep-SUF-PL-ACC-EVO) ‘sleepers’ (CPK:tip) 
yacha-k-wan (know-SUF-COM) ‘with the shaman’  (CPK:bec) 
paki-ri-k-gama (break-PASS-SUF-until) ‘until broken’ (CPK:aft) 
 
Verb + -k forms can be modified by demonstratives, such as chi ‘that,’ adjectives, such as 
ali ‘good,’ quantifiers, such as tukuy ‘all,’ and numbers. 
 
(4) chi yacha-k (that know-SUF) ‘that knower’ or ‘that shaman’ (CPK:bec) 
ali asna-k (good smell-SUF) ‘good smeller’ or ‘thing that smells good’ (CPK:umu) 
tukuy wañu-k-kuna (all die-SUF-PL) ‘all die-ers’ or ‘all those who die’ (CPK:thr) 
ishkay chunga tiya-k-guna (two ten exist-SUF-PL) ‘twenty existers’ (CPK:fin) 
 
Verb + -k forms can also be modified by postpositional phrases, as in (5) where they are 
underlined. While this behavior is not necessarily nominal, as PPs can also function as verbal 
complements, these data bear mentioning. 
 
(5) yaku-y tiya-k (water-LOC exist-SUF) ‘one that exists in the water’ (CPK:bec) 
perwano-ma ni-k (Peruvian-DAT say-SUF) ‘one that says (it) to the Peruvian’ (CPK:ser) 
ñuka-wan ri-g (1s-COM go-SUF) ‘one who goes with me’ (CPK:ams) 
yacha-k laro-i tiyari-k (shaman side-LOC sit-SUF) ‘one who sits by a shaman’ (CPK:bec) 
 
Verb + -k forms can function as verbal arguments, e.g., subject, as in (6) and (7), or direct 
object, as in (8) and (9). 
 
(6) ishkay  chunga  tiya-k-guna   ri-nawn    (CPK:fin) 
two      ten         exist-SUF-PL  go-3P 
21 
‘Twenty dwellers go’ 
 
(7) chi-bi      muyu-ta    apa-k-guna  shamu-naw-ra  (CPK:cha) 
that-LOC  fruit-ACC  take-SUF-PL  come-3P-PST 
‘There the fruit takers came’ 
 
(8) chi-ga,    yacha-k-guna-ta     kacha-nga,   haku!  (CPK:fin) 
that-TOP  know-SUF-PL-ACC  send-3S.FUT  let’s.go 
‘Then he will send the shaman, let’s go!’ 
 
(9) puñu-k-guna-ta-shi        kati-sha    ni-shka-ra...  (CPK:tip) 
sleep-SUF-PL-ACC-EVO  follow-SS  say-PERF-PST 
‘Following the sleepers, he said…’ 
 
Each of these behaviors, i.e., taking number and case morphology, being modified by 
demonstratives, articles, and quantifiers, and participating in verbal argument structure, is 
evidence of the noun-like function of verb + -k forms. 
 
2.2 Non-agentive 
 
The -k suffix is used with many verbs that refer to volitional actions, such as those in 
(10). 
 
(10) wakta-k (hit-SUF) ‘hitter’     (CPK:ser) 
shita-k (throw-SUF) ‘thrower’     (CPK:ado) 
salta-k (jump-SUF) ‘jumper’     (CPK:cha) 
ra-k (do/make-SUF) ‘do-er/maker’    (CPK:def) 
kallpa-k (run-SUF) ‘runner’     (CPK:the) 
hapi-k (catch-SUF) ‘catcher’     (CPK:thk) 
 
22 
However, it is observed that the PK suffix is also used with verbs of low animacy and 
low agentivity crosslinguistically. For this reason, the term “attributive” is preferred over the 
term “agentive” (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 180). In (11), Nuckolls & Swanson cite an 
example in which a native Kichwa speaking woman describes the design on a clay drinking 
bowl. 
 
(11) kasna    muyu-g        a-ra           lluw  ñambi-ga 
like.this  curve-SUF  be-PST-3S  IDEO  path-TOP 
‘As for the path, this is how it’s a curver, (going) lluw.’ 
(Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 180) 
 
The verb muyuna ‘to curve around’ receives the -k suffix (which is often voiced [g] in PK 
as it is here), and it is used to describe the ñambi ‘path.’ The use of a stative verb and a subject 
that cannot be an agent illustrate the reasons for Nuckolls & Swanson’s hesitation to use the term 
“agentive.” Rather, the verb with the -k suffix is used to “attribute” the quality of being curved to 
the path represented by the lines on the clay bowl. The term “attributive” is used to capture both 
the agentive and non-agentive uses of the -k suffix. (For many more examples of the -k suffix 
being used to attribute qualities to low animacy entities, see Nuckolls’ audiovisual archive of PK 
ideophones: http://quechuarealwords.byu.edu/.) 
Following is a sample of other examples of verb + -k forms derived from verbs that are 
crosslinguistically less agentive or volitional. 
 
(12) a-k (be-SUF) ‘be-er’      (CPK:aft) 
wañu-k (die-SUF) ‘die-er’     (CPK:ado) 
illa-k (lack-SUF) ‘lacker’     (CPK:ama) 
riku-ri-k (see-PASS-SUF) ‘appearer’    (CPK:pah) 
23 
puñu-k (sleep-SUF) ‘sleeper’     (CPK:fin) 
tiya-k (exist-SUF) ‘exister/dweller’    (CPK:thk) 
 
Nuckolls & Swanson are not the first to observe the non-agentive use of the “agentive” 
suffix in a Quechuan language. Snow (1973: 79) observed, in different words, the attributive 
quality of the -q suffix in Ancash Quechua (spoken in Ancash, Peru) when he said “the suffix -q 
occurs in relative clauses as an indication of a process performed by or a characteristic of a 
specified agent.” Though Snow discusses a “specified agent,” the observation that -q relative 
clauses can indicate “characteristics” implies something perhaps closer to Nuckolls & Swanson’s 
attributive. Costa (1972: 60) claims that “in [Peruvian] Quechua the agent noun form and relative 
clause form are the same, but when the -q suffix is used in a relative clause the noun referred to 
need not be animate.” And later, Weber (1983) explored relativization in Huallago Quechua, 
spoken in the Huanuco province, Peru, observing that relativization with -q is clearly not limited 
to agents. The following examples (13-17) are taken from that description. 
 
(13) qasa-q          yaku      (Weber 1983: 32) 
be.cold-SUF  water 
‘cold water’ 
 
(14) chunya-q        hirka      (Weber 1983: 32) 
be.silent-SUF  mountain 
‘deserted mountain’ 
 
(15) shunta-y     asukar  shikwa-q-ta    (Weber 1983: 32) 
gather-IMP  sugar    spilled-SUF-ACC 
‘Gather up the sugar that spilled.’ 
 
(16) chay  meesa  hanan-chaw  kayka-q     shikra   (Weber 1983: 32) 
that   table     its.top-LOC    being-SUF  basket 
‘that basket which is on top of the table’ 
24 
 
(17) huk  chay  wañu-q  kasta             aywan…   (Weber 1983: 32) 
one  that   die-SUF  clan/relation  goes 
‘one of the dead person’s relatives goes…’ 
 
In each instance, the relativized verb is intransitive and does not take an agent subject, 
with the exception of shikwa- ‘to spill’ which is transitive, but ‘sugar’ is its patient. Additionally, 
Weber observes that the NP head of the relative clause does not even need to be a physical 
object, as in (18): 
 
(18) … aybeesi        usha-q       fibreeru-chaw   (Weber 1983: 33) 
     sometimes  finish-SUF  february-LOC 
‘... sometimes during the end of February’ 
 
These observations are in line with Nuckolls & Swanson’s characterization of the non-
agentivity of the -k suffix in PK. Similar examples can be found in the CPK. (19) resembles 
Weber’s example in (17) with the verb wañuna ‘to die.’ 
 
(19) ñuka  wañu-k  mikia      (CPK:the) 
1S      die-SUF  aunt 
‘my late aunt’ 
 
In these examples and those given by Nuckolls & Swanson it is not agentivity that is 
important, rather the verb + -k forms are used to attribute qualities related to the verb, per 
Nuckolls & Swanson’s characterization. 
 
25 
2.3 Noun modifier 
 
Importantly, the examples given by Weber (13-16) differ from the examples given by 
Nuckolls & Swanson up to this point in that the verb + -k forms behave like adjectives, 
modifying a head noun. Example (19), above, shows that similar behavior can be found in the 
CPK. In the CPK there are 30 examples of verb + -k forms directly modifying nouns in this way. 
Following is a sample. 
 
(20) piña-k             rayu      (CPK:ray) 
be.angry-SUF  lightning 
‘angry lightning’ or ‘lightning that is angry’ 
 
(21) kasa-k      amarun      (CPK:ado) 
hunt-SUF  anaconda 
‘hunting anaconda’ or ‘anaconda that hunts’ 
 
(22) chuchu-chi-k       wawa-yuk     (CPK:est) 
breast-CAUS-SUF  baby-PSSR 
‘milk-giving baby-possessor’ or ‘one who has a baby and who gives milk’ 
 
In descriptions of other Quechuan varieties, it is chiefly because of this behavior that the -
k suffix is analyzed as a relativizer. A relative clause is a clause that modifies a noun in an NP. 
For example, in the English NP “the man who saw the movie,” the clause “who saw the movie” 
modifies the noun “the man.” Cole (1985) describes verb + -j forms in Imbabura Quechua, 
spoken in northern Ecuador, as relatives. As a Quechua II-B language of Ecuador, Imbabura 
Quechua is the most closely related variety to PK among those found in the literature. The 
Imbabura suffix -j [x] is described as an agentive nominalizer used to form present tense relative 
clauses (Cole 1985: 175). What this analysis implies, and indeed what Cole argues for, is that 
26 
when a verb + -k form is found as the head of an NP, i.e., not modifying a head noun, it can be 
considered a “headless relative,” i.e., a relative clause that does not have an overt head noun in 
the NP (Cole 1985: 175). This analysis means that the examples of noun-like behavior presented 
in section 2.1 would actually be examples of headless relative clauses. 
An important characteristic of relative clauses is the retention of verbal argument 
structure. This is exemplified by verb + -k forms assigning case, as in the following: 
 
(23) aswa-ta upi-k (aswa-ACC drink-SUF) ‘aswa drinker’  (CPK:can) 
warmi-ta muna-k (woman-ACC want-SUF) ‘woman wanter’ (CPK:ado) 
tinaha-ta wata-k (jar-ACC tie-SUF) ‘jar tie-er’  (CPK:aft) 
sawli-ta chari-k (machete-ACC have-SUF) ‘machete have-er’ (CPK:jag) 
 
In each instance, the direct object (in bold) is marked with the accusative suffix -ta. In 
PK, verbs always assign accusative case to a direct object. This means the verb + -k form, in 
addition to its noun-like qualities, also has verb-like qualities, being able to assign case, as well 
as the adjective-like function of modifying a head noun. 
One verb + -k form in the CPK is consistently found to not assign case, or at least its 
direct objects are consistently not marked with the accusative -ta. The verb illana ‘to lack’ 
becomes illa-k (lack-SUF) ‘lacker’ and is found in the CPK 17 times. Of these 12 co-occur with a 
direct object, i.e., the thing that is lacked, and none of these direct objects are marked with the 
accusative suffix -ta. For example: 
 
(24) kuchillu illa-k (knife lack-SUF) ‘knife lacker, or lacking a knife’ (CPK:fin) 
wawa illa-k (baby lack-SUF) ‘baby lacker, or lacking a baby’ (CPK:aft) 
kusa-ga illa-k (husband-TOP lack-SUF) ‘husband lacker, or lacking a husband’ (CPK:ama) 
illapa-s illa-k (rifle-DESP lack-SUF) ‘lacking even a rifle’ (CPK:fin) 
27 
 
Not only are none of the direct objects (in bold) marked with the accusative case, illa-k is 
the only verb + -k form that does not assign accusative case to its direct object in the CPK. This 
could be the result of colloquial usage, or simply incidental to the relatively small data set. It 
could also be explained that illa-k is perhaps a more derivational verb + -k form, deriving a more 
noun-like form that cannot assign case. This would imply that the direct object in each is 
compounded to the nominal verb + -k form, making each an example of a synthetic compound, 
an endocentric noun-noun compound in which the deverbal head retains its verbal argument 
structure, and the non-head element fills an argument of the verb, e.g., “truck driver” in English. 
The idea of a “more derivational” verb + -k form is not a novel one. Lefebvre & Muysken 
argue for an inflectional and a derivational version of the nominalizations in Cusco Quechua 
(Lefebvre & Muysken 1988: 64). Much of the evidence Lefebvre & Muysken present does not 
apply to PK because they rely heavily on certain interactions between nominal and verbal person 
markers that are not found in PK, as well as a verbal plural marker that does not exist in PK 
either. However, one of the key characteristics used to differentiate the two types is that 
inflectional nominalizations can have a direct object, while the lexicalized (derivational) ones 
cannot (Lefebvre & Muysken 1988: 67). That being said, they explain that it is “marginally 
possible” to have a direct object with a lexicalized agentive, as in (25). 
 
(25) papa    suwa-q      (Lefebvre & Muysken 1988: 67) 
potato  rob-SUF 
‘potato thief’ 
 
28 
This example from Cusco Quechua is a synthetic compound, potentially like the PK 
examples with illa-k. Thus, if we were to argue for a dichotomy in PK that resembles the one 
proposed by Lefebvre & Muysken, then the presence or absence of the accusative suffix -ta, i.e., 
case assignment, would be a differentiating feature in PK. Those verb + -k forms with 
accusative-marked direct objects would be instances of the inflectional -k, while those with 
unmarked direct objects compounded to the verb + -k form would be examples of the 
derivational -k. This definition is only useful in identifying the difference between verb + -k 
forms with direct objects, however, and there may be other instances, such as yacha-k (know-
SUF) ‘know-er,’ which have been lexicalized, in this case to mean ‘shaman’ in PK, though there 
is no distinct grammatical evidence in the CPK to distinguish them. 
 
2.4 Habitual aspect 
 
Nuckolls & Swanson also describe the use of the -k suffix in a compound verb 
construction used to convey the habitual aspect in PK (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 193). 
This is done by combining a verb + -k form and the verb ana ‘to be.’ This construction is most 
often used in the past tense and is often translated ‘used to,’ as in the following: 
 
(26) ñuka  yaya-guna  kallari-ga         Marañon-bi-shi        kachi-ta  apa-g       a-naw-ra 
1S      father-PL    beginning-TOP  Marañon-LOC-EVO   salt-ACC  take-SUF  be-3P-PST 
‘My fathers, in the old days, used to get salt in Marañon (river).’ 
      (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 192) 
 
29 
Examples of this construction are numerous. 56% (473 out of 846) of verb + -k instances 
in the CPK are part of this type of construction. Of those, nearly two thirds (289 out of 473) are 
in the past tense. An example of this construction in the past tense is given in (27), and a present 
tense example is given in (28). 
 
(27) ñuka  yaya    chasna   kwinta-k  a-ra    (CPK:ama) 
1S      father  like.that  tell-SUF   be-PST

Interestingly in 46 instances, the verb + -k form used with ana is itself a form of ana. 
(29) shows this construction used with a noun, (30) shows it with a predicate adjective, and (31) 
shows an adverb modifying the construction. 
 
(29) amarun    kara-manda-lla  amanga     m-a-k            a-shka-ra (CPK:fin)

lit. ‘It was a from-just-anaconda-skin be-er’

‘They are like that!’ 
 
30 
Of these 46 instances of “be stacking,” 16 of them are preceded by an additional verb 
with the -k suffix, as in (32), and (33). 
 
(32) pay-guna  randi-chi-sha  puri-k      a-k         a-shka  (CPK:fin) 
3-PL         trade-CAUS-SS  walk-SUF  be-SUF  be-PERF 
‘They used to walk selling.’ 
 
(33) chasna    ri-k       a-k        a-shka    (CPK:sui) 
like.that  go-SUF  be-SUF  be-PERF 
‘He used to go like that.’ 
 
These examples exhibit both “be stacking” and “-k stacking” behavior. The difference 
between these examples and examples like (26) could be paraphrased in English as the difference 
between “used to X” and “used to be one who Xes.” For example, compare (34) and (35). 
 
(34) taruga-ta  wañu-chi-k     a-ra     (CPK:aft) 
deer-ACC  die-CAUS-SUF  be-PST 
‘He used to kill deer’ 
 
(35) ñuka  yaya  mana  wañu-chi-k    a-g        a-ra  (CPK:ind) 
1S     father  NEG   die-CAUS-SUF  be-SUF  be-PST 
‘My father did not used to be a killer’ or ‘My father did not used to be one who kills’ 
 
In addition to these, there are four examples in the CPK of “-k stacking” composed of 
two non-copular verbs, as in (36). The first verb + -k form can be described as functioning 
adverbially to modify the habitual verb. The adverbial use of verb + -k forms is discussed in the 
next section. 
 
(36) chi-ga      maska-k      shamu-k-shi     a-naw-ra  (CPK:ado) 
31 
then-TOP  search-SUF  come-SUF-EVO   be-3P-PST 
‘Then they used to come searching’  
 
An important behavior of verb + -k forms that interact with ana that may support 
Nuckolls & Swanson’s analysis that these are compound verb forms, as opposed to nominal 
complements in a copular VP is the lack of plural marking on the verb + -k form in habitual 
constructions with plural subjects. Consider the following six examples, (37) through (42). Each 
of the six combinations of number and person are represented, starting with first person singular 
and ending with third person plural, in the present tense. 
 
(37) 1st person singular: 
chi-guna-ta  mana  miku-k   a-ni     (CPK:mac) 
that-PL-ACC  NEG    eat-SUF  be-1S 
‘I don’t eat those’ 
 
(38) 2nd person singular:

this  woman-PL-ACC-IRR  know-SUF  be-2S 
‘Do you know these women?’ 
 
(39) 3rd person singular: 
pay-mi    chasna    ra-k      a-n    (CPK:def) 
3S-EVS    like.that  do-SUF  be-3S 
‘He does (it) like that’ 
 
(40) 1st person plural: 
ñukanchi  ni-k       a-nchi     (CPK:fin) 
1P            say-SUF  be-1P 
‘We say (it)’ 
 
(41) 2nd person plural: 
pakta-k      a-ngichi       (CPK:def) 
arrive-SUF  be-2P 
‘You all arrive’ 
32 
 
(42) 3rd person plural: 
chasna    ni-k        a-nawn      (CPK:man) 
like.that  say-SUF  be-3P 
‘They say (it) like that’ 
 
Summarizing these data paradigmatically, the habitual aspect construction follows the 
pattern in Table 7. 
 
Table 7: Habitual aspect paradigm 
 SINGULAR PLURAL 
1ST -k  a-ni -k  a-nchi 
2ND -k  a-ngi -k  a-ngi-chi 
3RD -k  a-n -k  a-nawn 
 
Importantly, examples (40), (41), and (42) each have plural subjects, yet the verb + -k 
form does not receive plural marking. This pattern is also found in the past habitual. For 
example, (43) and (44) exhibit the same behavior in 1P and 3P. 
 
(43) pacha-wan-mi        puñu-k      a-ra-nchi   (CPK:fin) 
blanket-INST-EVS   sleep-SUF  be-PST-1P 
‘We used to sleep with blankets’ 
 
(44) yana!  shinki!  kiru-yuk      m-a-k            a-naw-ra!  (CPK:ama) 
black  black     tooth-PSSR  EVS-be-SUF   be-3P-PST 
‘Black! Black! They used to have (black) teeth!’ or ‘they used to be teeth-possessors’ 
 
33 
The lack of plural marking on the verb + -k forms may suggest that they are not 
functioning as arguments of the verb, especially when compared to examples in which the verb + 
-k form is marked plural (as in section 2.1). However, there are examples of verb + -k forms 
exhibiting this same behavior with non-copular verbs, as in (45). 
 
(45) pay-guna-ga  yacha-k     tuku-nawn     (CPK:bec) 
3-PL-TOP        know-SUF  become-3P 
‘They become shamans’ 
 
We will also see in the discussion of the adverbial function of verb + -k forms in the next 
section that the nominal plural is not used where expected in that function either. It is possible 
that these two functions, the habitual aspect marker and the adverbial, are a single function, i.e., 
verb modifier, that has the semantic value of habitual when used with the copula. 
 
2.5 Adverbial 
 
Nuckolls & Swanson observe that a verb + -k form is sometimes used with non-copular 
verbs in a way that cannot be described as filling an argument of the main verb, nor as part of the 
habitual construction. In these instances, the verb + -k form is said to behave adverbially to 
modify the main verb by attributing an additional quality to it (Nuckolls & Swanson, 
forthcoming: 209). Two verbs that are most often modified by verb + -k forms are shamuna ‘to 
come’ and rina ‘to go.’ 
 
(46) yanapa-k  shamu-sha    (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 267) 
34 
help-SUF   come-1S.FUT 
‘I will come and help.’ or ‘(as a) helper, I’ll come.’ 
 
(47) ñuka  apa-k      ri-sha    (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 267) 
1S      take-SUF  go-1S.FUT 
‘I’ll go and take some.’ or ‘(as a) taker, I’ll go.’ 
 
It is common, according to Nuckolls & Swanson, to see this construction in the 
imperative mood (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 178). 
 
(48) yanapa-k  shamu-y!    (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 178) 
help-SUF   come-IMP 
‘Come and help!’ lit. ‘(as a) helper, come!’ 
 
In these instances, it is difficult to say that the verb + -k form is functioning as a noun in 
the verb’s argument structure, as the person being addressed has not yet come or gone, etc. 
Additionally, verb + -k forms that are used adverbially do not receive plural marking, even when 
the subject of the verb is plural. As with the habitual aspect paradigm, if these verb + -k forms 
were functioning as complements or arguments to a plural verb, it would be expected that they 
would receive plural marking, but this is not the case. For example: 
 
(49) ayllu-guna  apa-k       shamu-naw-ra    (CPK:sui) 
family-PL    take-SUF  come-3P-PST 
‘Families come as takers’ 
 
(50) pay-guna  hapi-k      shamu-kpi-s,     sinzhi  kallpa-ngi (CPK:fin) 
3-PL          hunt-SUF  come-DS-DESP  strong  run-2S 
‘If they come as hunters, run strong (i.e., fast)’ 
 
35 
Looking outside PK, Parker (1969) claims that q-nominalizations in Ayacucho Quechua 
can function adverbially, indicating “purpose of action,” when used with a verb of motion, as in 
miku- ‘eat’ → miku-q ‘eat-SUF’ in the phrase mikuqmi hataric̆kani ‘I’m getting up to eat’ (Parker 
1969: 57). Parker presents the data without glosses, but presumably hataric̆kani means ‘I’m 
getting up.’ This analysis supports Nuckolls & Swanson’s characterization of the adverbial 
function of the -k suffix, especially with shamuna ‘to come’ and rina ‘to go’ being described as 
the most commonly used verbs, since these are verbs of motion. 
Alternatively, Lefebvre & Muysken (1988) argue that the agent noun suffix in Cusco and 
other varieties of Quechua is used to mark the complement of a motion verb (Lefebvre & 
Muysken 1988: 22). The key criteria used to identify -k complements, according to this analysis, 
is that the verb + -k form cannot escape the matrix verb phrase to move to topic position. This 
theoretical assertion could be called into question if examples can be found in the CPK of a verb 
+ -k form in topic position. Such an example would be identified by a verb + -k form marked by 
the topic marker -ga. In example (51) the topic marker is bold. 
 
(51) palanda-ta     apa-k-ga         shamu-nchi   (CPK:jag) 
plantain-ACC  take-SUF-TOP  come-1P 
‘Taking the plantains, we come’ or ‘As plantain-takers we come’ 
 
In the generative version of syntax that Lefebvre & Muysken are writing in, the topic 
marker in this example strongly suggests that the verb + -k form has left the matrix VP to move 
up to topic position. This implies that either the -k suffix is not a complementizer in PK, or that 
Lefebvre’s argumentation does not apply to the PK data. In any case, there is not compelling 
36 
evidence that the -k suffix in PK is a complementizer. I, therefore, maintain Nuckolls & 
Swanson’s characterization of this behavior as adverbial. 
In the CPK there are 87 examples of verb + -k forms functioning adverbially in the way 
described by Nuckolls & Swanson. Of these, 80% (70 out of 87) modify the verb shamuna ‘to 
come,’ as in (52) (and (36) in section 2.4). 7 modify the verb rina ‘to go,’ as in (53). The 
remaining instances modify various other verbs, such as nina ‘to say’ and puñuna ‘to sleep, as in 
(54) and (55), respectively. 
 
(52) kuti-lla-ta            ashka  uya-ri-k            shamu-ra  (CPK:ado) 
again-DESP-ADV  a.lot    hear-PASS-SUF  come-PST 
‘Again, very loudly it came.’ 
 
(53) chi   ruya-y     kanta-k    ri-u-ngi    (CPK:tay) 
that  tree-LOC  sing-SUF  go-DUR-2S 
‘In that tree as a singer you are going.’ 
 
(54) kasna      rima-k       ni-ra-ni     (CPK:def) 
like.this  speak-SUF  say-PST-1S 
‘Speaking like this, I said (it).’ 
 
(55) musku-k      puñu-gri      (CPK:how) 
dream-SUF  sleep-TRLC.IMP 
‘(As a) dreamer go and sleep!’ 
 
Of note, in PK the translocative suffix -gri, seen in (55), is used with a verb to convey the 
sense that the subject of the verb transfers to another location. Nuckolls & Swanson explain that 
this suffix can roughly be understood as “to-go-and-do-something” (Nuckolls & Swanson, 
forthcoming: 201). 
 
37 
(56) maytu-na  panga-ta  ukta      maska-gri-chi! 
roast-INF  leaf-ACC   quickly  search-TRLC-2P.IMP 
‘(You-all) go quickly and search for roasting leaves!’ 
(Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 201) 
 
Historically, the translocative suffix -gri “developed from a… periphrastic construction” 
(Muysken 2000: 983) composed of a verb + -k form and the verbal root ri- ‘go.’ The existence of 
this suffix does not, however, prohibit the use of a verb + -k form with the verb rina ‘to go,’ as 
seen in (38), above. Since the -k suffix is often pronounced as a voiced [g], especially when 
followed by a voiced consonant, the forms of verb + -k ri- and verb + -gri can look identical. In 
addition, since there is little to no semantic difference, the two are only distinguishable based on 
prosodic features, such as intonation. In a few instances in the CPK, the difference is made clear 
by intervening morphology between the verb + -k form and rina. This can be seen in (57) below 
where the verb + -k form is substantive and marked with the nominal plural suffix -guna. 
 
(57) ishkay  chunga  tiya-k-guna   ri-nawn   (CPK:fin) 
two      ten         exist-SUF-PL  go-3P 
‘Twenty dwellers go’ 
 
There is some evidence that speakers may be aware to a degree of the relationship 
between -gri and the verb rina. When one considers that example (58) would have historically 
been read as in (59), a parallel structure can be seen, i.e., adverb verb, adverb verb. 
 
(58) rima-gri,               kunan  ri!     (CPK:thk) 
speak-TRLC.IMP  now    go.IMP 
‘Go-and-speak, go now!’ 
 
38 
(59) rima-g        ri,        kunan  ri! 
speak-SUF  go.IMP  now    go.IMP 
‘Go and speak, go now!’ lit. ‘As a speaker go, now go!’ 
 
Returning to Nuckolls & Swanson’s description of the adverbial function of verb + -k 
forms, it is said that these often modify verbs in the imperative mood. In the CPK, 12 (out of 87) 
adverbial verb + -k forms modify imperative verbs, as in (55), above, and (60), (61), and (62), 
below. 
 
(60) yanu-shka-ta      miku-k  shamu-i    (CPK:can) 
cook-PERF-ACC  eat-SUF  come-IMP 
‘Come as an eater of cooked (things)!’ 
 
(61) aswa-ta     upi-k          shamu-i    (CPK:can) 
aswa-ACC  drink-SUF  come-IMP 
‘Come drink aswa!’ 
 
(62) llapi-shka-ta           riku-k     shamu-i-chi,  wawa-guna (CPK:jag) 
squeeze-PERF-ACC  see-SUF  come-IMP-2P  child-PL 
‘Come as seers of aswa pulp (lit. that which is squeezed), children!’ 
 
In these three examples, notice that the direct object of the verb from which the verb + -k 
form is derived is marked with the accusative -ta. This suggests that the verb + -k has retained 
some of its underlying argument structure, as seen in the relative clause analysis in section 2.3. 
This may indicate that the relative function and the adverbial function are not so different. 
 
2.6 Connection to -shka 
 
39 
In PK, the verb + -shka is described as a verbal “adjective” derived from the present 
perfect suffix -shka (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 237). The present perfect suffix attaches 
to a main verb and can co-occur with subject agreement morphology, as in (63). 
 
(63) ñuka  ri-shka-ni    (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 237) 
1S      go-PRES.PERF-1S 
‘I’ve gone’ 
 
Adjectival verb + -shka forms, on the other hand, which can refer to a completed action, 
the result of a completed action, or the patient of a completed action, cannot function as main 
verbs. Rather they can be used to modify nouns, as in (64) and (65), and do not take subject 
agreement morphology. A parallel will be drawn between -shka and -k that calls into question the 
classification of -shka, and for this reason it is glossed as SUF2. 
 
(64) yanu-shka   mikuna  tiya-n   (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 242) 
cook-SUF2  food       exist-3S 
‘There is cooked food’ or ‘food that is cooked exists’ 
 
(65) mikuna  yanu-shka  a-n   (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 242) 
food      cook-SUF2  be-3S 
‘The food is cooked.’ 
 
The adjective form and the present prefect construction are functionally similar, though 
formally distinct, as seen in (66) compared to (67). 
  
(66) macha-shka-ngi-chu?    (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 237) 
be.drunk-PRES.PERF-2S-IRR 
‘Have you become drunk?’ 
40 
 
(67) macha-shka-chu     a-ngi?   (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 237) 
be.drunk-SUF2-IRR  be-2S 
‘Are you drunk?’ 
 
Nuckolls & Swanson observe that verb + -shka forms can take nominal morphology, 
such as plural -guna and accusative -ta (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 242). These 
observations are corroborated by the data in the CPK, as in (68). 
 
(68) wañu-chi-shka-guna (die-CAUS-SUF2-PL) ‘those that are killed’ (CPK:thr) 
hapi-shka-guna (catch-SUF2-PL) ‘those which are caught’ (CPK:fin) 
yanu-shka-ta (cook-SUF2-ACC) ‘that which is cooked’ (CPK:can) 
shamu-shka-ta (come-SUF2-ACC) ‘that which has come’ (CPK:fin) 
 
The characterization of -shka appears similar in a number of ways to the characterization 
of the -k suffix in that they both are derived from verbs, they both can function as noun 
modifiers, and they both can function as the head of an NP and take nominal morphology. The 
suffix -shka is often associated with -k in a contrasting relationship throughout the literature on 
Quechuan languages. In Chimborazo Quechua, for example, Catta Quelen describes the -c [k] 
suffix as a “habitual participle” translated into Spanish as el que… ‘the one who….’ This is 
followed by a description of the suffix -shca which is also analyzed as a participle, but one 
meaning el que ha… ‘the one who has…’ or el que está… ‘the one who is…’ (Catta Quelen, 
1985: 164). This seems to match the behavior seen in the PK fairly well. This analysis is echoed 
in Coombs (1976), Gomez Bacarreza (1988), and Debenbach-Salazar Saenz (1993). 
Furthermore, Weber (1983), Weber (1989), Parker (1969), Samanez Flores (1996), and Huarachi 
Revello (2005) also analyze the equivalent suffix as a participle. 
41 
Weber examines the suffix -sha in Huallaga Quechua, which was historically -shqa 
before the loss of the [q] segment (Weber 1983: 18). Verb + -sha forms are analyzed as past 
participles with an “ergative pattern” (Weber 1989: 283-4), meaning here that with intransitive 
verbs, the participle is oriented toward the subject, as in (69), while with transitive verbs, the 
participle is oriented toward the object, as in (70). 
 
(69) wañu-sha  runa      (Weber 1989: 284) 
die-PRTC   man 
‘the man who died’ 
 
(70) maqa-sha  runa      (Weber 1989: 284) 
hit-PRTC    man 
‘the hit man’ or ‘the man who was hit’ 
 
Data from the CPK appears to match this characterization, as seen in (71) and (72), 
below, which mirror the constructions above. 
 
(71) wañu-shka  mikia      (CPK:the) 
die-SUF2     aunt 
‘an aunt who died’ 
 
(72) pinta-shka  amarun      (CPK:ado) 
paint-SUF2  anaconda 
‘painted anaconda’ or ‘anaconda that is painted’ (referring to the pattern on its skin) 
 
It is likely that the -shka suffix in PK is a participle similar to those described in the 
literature on other Quechuan languages. An alternative analysis presented by Cole (1985), Soto 
Ruiz (1976), Lefebvre & Muysken (1988), Alderetes (2001), and Escribens (1970) is that the 
equivalent suffixes are relative nominalizers that refer to a perfective or completed action. 
42 
In Imbabura Quechua, Cole claims that the -k and -shka suffixes are part of a paradigm of 
clausal nominalizers that indicate the tense of the subordinate relative clause in which they are 
found. According to Cole, -j [x] signifies a present tense relative clause, -shka marks a past tense 
relative clause, and -na is used for future relative clauses. The following sentences illustrate 
these relationships. In each, the full NP is underlined. The subordinate relative clause is in bold 
and, as part of the NP, is also underlined. 
 
(73)  a. Marya  riku-shka  runa  Past   (Cole 1985: 47) 
Maria   see-SUF2   man 
‘The man whom Maria saw’ 
 
b. Marya  riku-j     runa   Present 
Maria   see-SUF  man 
‘The man whom Maria sees’ 
 
c. Marya  riku-na   runa   Future 
Maria   see-NOM  man 
‘The man whom Maria will see’ 
 
I turn to the CPK to compare this characterization to the behavior of these suffixes in PK. 
The CPK does not contain three examples of the exact same sentence with only a difference in 
the nominalizing suffix, but rough equivalents can be found. In (74), below, a verb + -shka form 
modifying a noun is shown. (75a-b) both contain verbs + -k forms. Because a single phrase with 
the -k suffix, a direct object, and modified head could not be found, both (75a), which shows the 
verb + -k form with a preceding object, and (75b), which shows the verb + -k form modifying a 
head noun, are presented. Lastly, (76) employs a verb + -na form to modify a noun. Each of 
these are marked in the same way as above, with the NP in question underlined and the clause 
(called by Cole a relative clause) in bold.

that  town-ABL        cross-NOM   stick   lie-3S 
‘The stick for crossing (a lake) from that town is lying there.’ 
 
To compare the PK data to Cole’s examples in (73), I will start with -shka. Cole calls the 
-shka suffix a past participle (Cole 1985; 134), and Nuckolls & Swanson’s characterization of -
shka could also be described as a participle, i.e., deverbal adjective; thus (74) might more 
accurately be glossed “the not woman-wanted man,” and (73a) might more accurately be glossed 
“the Maria-seen man,” analogous in structure to “the flea-bitten dog,” i.e., the dog which is bitten 
by fleas. In essence, the head noun (runa in both) is the patient in the underlying argument 
structure, and the noun modifying the verb + -shka form (Mariya and warmi, respectively) is the 
agent. 
Looking at Cole’s translation of (73b) it is clear that the head noun (runa) is still the 
patient, like with verb + -shka; however, in PK the argument structure is reversed, with the head 
noun in (75b) (amarun) being the agent, not the patient, in the underlying argument structure. 
What this means is that if a PK speaker heard Cole’s example (75b) Marya riku-j runa, the PK 
44 
speaker would understand it to mean the ‘the man who sees Maria’ or the ‘Maria-seer man,’ i.e., 
the exactly opposite situation understood by the Imbabura speaker. 
It should be mentioned, however, that Cole’s discussion on the proposed subordinate 
tense paradigm is the only place that Cole translates a verb + -j form modifying a head noun with 
the head noun as the patient. In every other example throughout his description, the head noun 
modified by a verb + -j form is the agent, as in (778) where the head noun wambra ‘boy’ is the 
head noun and agent of the verb + -j form michi-j (heard-SUF) ‘hearder.’ 
 
(77) wagra-ta   michi-j     wambra-ka  ña         shamu-ju-n-mi (Cole 1985: 75) 
cattle-ACC  herd-SUF  boy-TOP      already  come-PROG-3S-EVS 
‘The boy who herds cattle is coming.’ 
 
The translation of (77) matches the interpretation a PK speaker would have of this 
sentence. The inconsistency in Cole’s description may cast suspicion on Cole’s proposed 
subordinate tense paradigm, and in fact Lefebvre & Muysken, in their discussion of relative 
clauses and Quechua nominalizations (-q, -sqa, and -na), claim that the -q suffix in Cusco 
Quechua always marks the subject of the relative clause, as in (78). 
 
(78) Mariya  riku-q    runa-qa    (Lefebvre & Muysken 1988: 175) 
Maria    see-SUF  man-TOP 
‘the man that sees Maria’ 
 
This means that (78) can never be used to mean *‘the man whom Maria sees’ (Lefebvre 
& Musken 1988: 175). Lefebvre & Muysken do not mention Cole (1985) explicitly in regard to 
this example, but it is possible that this is intended as a correction, as they were certainly aware 
45 
of Cole’s analysis, citing him multiple times throughout their book, and they use the exact same 
phrase used by Cole. 
To summarize, the -shka suffix in PK is described by Nuckolls & Swanson as an 
“adjective” form of a verb that has been completed. In descriptions of other Quechuan languages, 
the equivalent suffix is described as either a past participle or a nominalizer that refers to the 
patient of a completed action. Throughout the literature, the -k suffix and the -shka suffix have 
been presented in a contrasting relationship, either as active vs. inactive participles, agent vs. 
patient nominalizers, or (by Cole) present vs. past relative subordinators. In our discussion of the 
-k suffix, an understanding of the -shka suffix may inform our conclusion if it is shown that the 
two suffixes are members of the same category. 
 
2.7 Chapter summary 
 
In summary, the attributive -k suffix, as described by Nuckolls & Swanson, is a deverbal 
nominalizer, though evidence has been presented that the resulting verb + -k form could also be 
described as a relativizer. Four main functions of verb + -k forms have been described: a) 
nominal, capable of receiving nominal morphology, b) adjectival, modifying nouns to attribute a 
quality to the noun, c) verbal in a habitual construction in tandem with the verb ana ‘to be,’ and 
d) adverbial, modifying verbs to attribute a quality to the verb. Although, if -k is a relativizer, 
then verb + -k forms functioning nominally would be reanalyzed as headless relatives, thus 
conflating these two categories. Also, some doubt was cast on the need to distinguish between 
the habitual and the adverbial functions of verb + -k forms. It has also been shown that the suffix 
46 
-shka functions in many of the same ways the -k suffix functions, i.e., nominally and adjectivally, 
and may constitute a contrasting suffix of the same category. 
In the next chapter, I discuss typological and theoretical explanations for the suffix’s 
behavior in PK. 
  
47 
Chapter 3: Analysis 
 
The purpose of this chapter is to explore typological and theoretical explanations for the 
behavior and usage of the -k suffix in PK based on data presented in chapter 2. In this chapter I 
discuss previous analyses of equivalent suffixes in other Quechuan languages as well as 
typological descriptions of key linguistics traits to determine how well they match the PK data. 
Ultimately, I appeal to a typological description of participles (Shagal 2017) and conclude that 
the behavior of the -k suffix in PK most closely matches crosslinguistic behaviors of active (or 
nominative) participles. To reach this conclusion, I first determine if verb + -k forms are nouns or 
relative clauses. Then after establishing them as relatives, namely participial relatives, I define 
the term participle. Finally, I support this conclusion by solidifying the parallel between -k and -
shka. 
 
3.1 Noun or Relative 
 
A core question of how to categorize the -k suffix comes down to how to reconcile the 
noun-like and the adjective-like behavior exhibited by verb + -k forms. It has been observed that 
verb + -k forms in PK can function like nouns, taking nominal morphology and standing as 
arguments of a main verb (see section 2.1), and like adjectives, modifying a head noun (see 
section 2.3). The question is, are these nouns that can function as modifiers, or are these 
modifiers that can function as nouns? 
I first consider the nominal interpretation. Comrie & Thompson (2007) discussing the 
typology of lexical nominalizations said concerning nominalizations modifying nouns: 
48 
 
(79) “It is not difficult to understand how a nominalization can function as a relative 
clause: the nominalization and the noun with which it is in construction can be 
thought of as two juxtaposed nominal elements [nom] [nom], the modifying 
relationship between them being inferred by the language users (rather than being 
specified by the grammar, as it is in languages with specific relative clause 
morphology), just as the modifying relationship is inferred in a noun–noun 
compound such as tree-house, in which the two nominal elements simply happen 
to be single nouns.”    (Comrie & Thompson 2007: 378) 
 
 
Importantly, Comrie & Thompson distinguish between a nominalization that functions as 
a relative and a relative clause with specific morphology in a language that specifies a 
relationship between the relative element and the nominal head. This could imply that if one 
were attempting to distinguish between a nominalization and a relative clause, one might look 
for ways in which the relationship between the modifying element and the head noun are 
“specified by the grammar.” It could be that the contrast between the -k suffix and the -shka 
suffix constitutes a morphological means by which PK indicates the modifying relationship 
between modifier and head noun, i.e., -k for agent vs. -shka patient, as in (80) and (81). 
 
(80) kasa-k      amarun      (CPK:ado) 
hunt-SUF  anaconda 
‘hunting anaconda’ or ‘anaconda that hunts’  
 
(81) pinta-shka  amarun      (CPK:ado) 
paint-SUF2  anaconda 
‘painted anaconda’ or ‘anaconda that was painted’ 
 
The modifying relationships in these examples is not merely inferred; it is specified by 
the morphology. This suggests that perhaps -k and -shka are not lexical nominalizations, but 
49 
rather relative clauses. That being said, the implication is that verb + -k forms that are not used to 
modify nouns, those that function as the head of an NP, are “headless” relatives, meaning 
relative clauses that lack an overt head noun. Cole argues for this analysis in Imbabura Quechua 
based on the logical extension of verb + -k forms being relatives (Cole 1985: 175). This analysis 
is reiterated by Lefebvre & Muysken (1988). In order to explain the use of nominal morphology 
with verb + -q forms in Cusco Quechua, it is shown that the nominal plural -kuna is carried by 
the “rightmost lexical nominal element in the noun phrase” which is not necessarily the head of 
the noun phrase (Lefebvre & Muysken 1988: 107). (82a-c) are provided by way of illustration. 
 
(82)  a. wasi-kuna      (Lefebvre & Muysken 1988: 107) 
house-PL 
‘houses’ 
 
b. allin-kuna 
good-PL 
‘good ones’ 
 
c. hamu-q-kuna 
come-SUF-PL 
‘those who come’ 
 
In (82a) the plural -kuna attaches to the noun wasi ‘house’ unproblematically, as this is 
the head noun. In (82b) the same suffix is attached to allin ‘good’ which is classified as an 
adjective, i.e., not the head of the NP. The authors claim that there is an “understood empty noun 
to the right of the lexical element carrying the plural marker” (Lefebvre & Muysken 1988: 108). 
With these two examples in mind, Lefebvre & Muysken present (82c) in which the nominal 
plural -kuna is attached to the verb + -q form hamu-q (come-SUF) ‘comer.’ The argument is made 
that (82c) is more like (82b) in that -kuna is attached to an “understood empty noun,” rather than 
50 
in (82a) where -kuna is attached directly to the noun itself. Looking to the CPK, it appears these 
observations can be made of PK as well. (83a-c) show similar behavior with the nominal plural -
guna in PK. 
 
(83)  a. warmi-guna       (CPK:ams) 
woman-PL 
‘women’ 
 
b. ali-guna       (CPK:sun) 
good-PL 
‘good ones’ 
 
c. shamu-k-guna        (CPK:per) 
come-SUF-PL 
‘those who come’ 
 
Further support for the headless relative analysis can be found in Baker & Vinokurova 
(2009) which attempts to identify ways in which “agent-denoting nominalizations” such as the 
English -er are distinct from other phenomena. While Baker & Vinokurova are explicitly 
motivated by a desire to find evidence for features of “Chomskyan” universal grammar (Baker & 
Vinokurova 2009: 521), their typological analyses may still be valid even outside of that theory, 
as their crosslinguistic investigation is supported by data from 78 languages from Koptjevskaja-
Tamm (2005)’s typology of action nominals found in the “World Atlas of Language Structures.” 
One of Baker & Vinokurova’s goals was to “ distinguish expressions like the manager of 
the company from expressions like the [one who] manages the company or the [one] managing 
the company where the pronominal head 'one' and the relative pronoun 'who' might both be 
phonologically null, as is often the case in languages other than English” (Baker & Vinokurova 
2009: 537). This dilemma is the same as the one we are trying to resolve in regard to PK, i.e., an 
51 
agentive nominalization, as in the first expression above, versus a relative clause with a 
phonologically null head (headless), as in the other two expressions. 
By looking at agentive nominalizations in English, Sakha (Turkic: Norther Siberia), and 
Mapadungan (Isolate: Chile), Baker & Vinokurova identified certain verbal properties that can 
be used to differentiate between agent nominalization and headless relative clauses. Then, with 
each of the 78 languages, Baker & Vinokurova identified how the “closest equivalents to an -er 
nominalization” are expressed. They identified whether the nominalization could only refer to 
the “subject argument of an agentive verb,” or if it was less restricted. Lastly, they looked for any 
verbal properties beyond taking a theme argument that were exhibited by both the restricted and 
less-restricted nominalizations (Baker & Vinokurova 2009: 543). As a result, they found that the 
languages fell into four categories: “languages with a true agentive nominalizer;” “languages 
with headless/participial relatives, potentially mistakable for agent nominalizer;” “languages 
with both agentive nominalizer and headless/participial relatives;” and “languages with neither 
(but have only, for example, headed relative clauses)” (Baker & Vinokurova 2009: 550-2). 
Listed among languages in the third category, Imbabura Quechua is described as having 
both an agentive nominalizer, -dur, which is “not used verbally” and “allows only bare 
(incorporated?) object[s],” and a headless/participial relative -j, which “can modify overt nouns; 
is okay with accusative object; [and] is also used as a finite verb form” (Baker & Vinokurova 
2009: 552). These observations were based on Cole (1985: 175) which we have already 
discussed. 
Looking now to PK, by comparing data from the CPK to Baker & Vinokurova’s 
characterization of agentive nominalizations, it may be possible to identify the category PK falls 
52 
into. The four key verbal properties that Baker & Vinokurova established as criteria for 
identifying agentive nominalizations are listed in (84). 
 
(84) a. agentive nominalizations will not have TAM marking 
b. agentive nominalizations cannot be negated with negative verbal morphology 
c. agentive nominalizations cannot use passive morphology 
d. agentive nominalizations cannot be modified by adverbs 
       (Baker & Vinokurova, 2009: 540) 
 
Starting with the first criterion which states agentive nominalizations cannot co-occur 
with TAM morphology, (85) and (86) both show the -k suffix used in tandem with the durative 
marker -u. As an indicator of aspect, this violates the first criterion. 
 
(85) shuk  amigo  chari-u-k-ga     (CPK:est) 
one   friend   have-DUR-SUF-TOP 
‘One who has one friend’ 
 
(86) pay  kusa-ndi         ri-u-k           uya-kpi-ga   (CPK:man) 
3S    husband-and  go-DUR-SUF  hear-DS-TOP 
‘She and her husband, who are going, heard (it)’ 
 
The second criterion, which states that agentive nominalizations cannot be negated by 
verbal negation, is clearly violated by (87). 
 
(87) mana  manzha-k!      (CPK:fin) 
NEG    fear-SUF 
‘Don’t fear!’ or ‘don’t be one who fears’ 
 
53 
The third criterion states that agentive nominalizations cannot use passive morphology. 
This criterion is violated by examples (88) and (89) in which the verbal stem contains the passive 
suffix -ri. 
 
(88) KAUUUUUUUU  yaku  uya-ri-g            a-n   (CPK:ams) 
IDEO                      river   hear-PASS-SUF  be-3S 
‘[sound] the river sounds/is heard’ 
 
(89) chasna    riku-ri-k         m-a-n     (CPK:ram) 
like.that  see-PASS-SUF  EVS-be-3S 
‘Like that he appears/is seen’ 
 
Finally, (90) and (91) are modified by adverbs, thus violating the fourth criterion. 
 
(90) ashka  puri-k       m-a-n     (CPK:per) 
a.lot     walk-SUF  EVS-be-3S 
‘He walks a lot’ 
 
(91) yapa  manzha-g  m-a-ni,        ñuka  puma-ta   (CPK:ams) 
very  fear-SUF     EVS-be-1S    1S      jaguar-ACC 
‘I am very scared of jaguar’ 
 
Verb + -k forms in PK are found to violate each criterion set out by Baker & Vinokurova, 
which supports the conclusion that verb + -k forms in PK are not agentive nominalizations, but 
rather headless relatives. That, however, is not to say that there are not lexical nominalizations in 
PK. As was discussed in section 2.3, Lefebvre & Muysken (1988) introduced the idea of 
inflectional vs. derivational versions of the -q suffix in Cusco Quechua. It was shown that the 
presence or absence of accusative marking on the direct object in PK could indicate a similar 
distinction in PK. Because of this, illa-k (lack-SUF) ‘lacker’ and yacha-k (know-SUF) ‘shaman’ 
54 
were suggested as potentially two derivational uses of the -k suffix. The ability or inability to 
assign accusative case was also used by Baker & Vinokurova to differentiate the suffixes in 
Imbabura Quechua that were described as agentive nominals, -dur versus -j (see above). 
Furthermore, in the CPK no form of illa-k or yacha-k violate any of Baker & Vinokurova’s 
criteria. While this is not conclusive, it is suggestive of a small (potentially 2 forms) subset of 
derivational verb + -k forms. The majority, however, are inflectional, by this analysis. In the next 
section it will be argued that verb + -k forms are participles, which are shown by Shagal (2017) 
to be inflectional verb forms. 
 
3.2 Participles 
 
Throughout the literature on the -k suffix and its equivalents in Quechuan languages, a 
number of authors have described verb + -k forms as participles (Markham 1864; Weber 1989; 
Guardia Mayorga 1973; Catta Quelen 1985; Debenbach-Salazar Saenz 1993; Muysken 1994). As 
mentioned in section 1.3.1 of this thesis, the term participle is not clearly defined in the literature. 
Weber defines participles in Huallago Quechua as “de-verbal substantives that characterize some 
referent as persisting in some state” (Weber 1989: 282). Debenbach-Salazar Saenz defines 
participles simply as “nominalizations of verbal roots that can combine with nominal suffixes” 
(Debenbach-Salazar Saenz 1993: 28). Muysken describes the verb + -q forms in Cusco Quechua 
as agentive nominalizations that “can head a participle clause that can modify a nominal head, 
and hence function as a ‘relative clause’” (Muysken 1994: 2,813). According to these definitions 
the term “participle” seems synonymous with the term “nominalization.” Returning to the 
original question of whether verb + -k forms are nouns with modifier functions or modifiers with 
55 
noun functions, these definitions, especially Muysken’s, favor the former; however, it has been 
shown in the previous section that verb + -k forms in PK are likely not nominalizations, rather 
they are relative clauses that can modify nouns, even if the head is phonologically null. This 
means that the definitions of participle in the Quechuan literature are inadequate to describe the -
k suffix in PK, but that does not dismiss the possibility of verb + -k forms being participles. 
Baker & Vinokurova, in the paper that supported the non-nominal analysis of verb + -k forms, 
refers to the non-nominal forms as participial relatives (Baker & Vinokurova 2009: 549). To 
further our understanding of participles, I turn to Shagal (2017). 
Shagal attempts to establish a definition and comparative description of participles by 
looking at over 100 languages from various families and areas. After discussing numerous 
traditional definitions and finding the majority to be inadequate, Shagal defines participles as 
“morphosyntactically deranked verb forms that can be employed for adnominal modification” 
(Shagal 2017: 1). Shagal refers to the work of Stassen (1985) who introduced the terms deranked 
and balanced. According to Stassen, the verb of a dependent clause that has the same structure as 
an independent clause in a given language is considered balanced; while the verb of a dependent 
clause that differs from an independent clause morphologically or syntactically and that has been 
marked somehow to show the difference is considered deranked (Shagal 2017; 2). For example, 
a subordinate verb that is marked with a suffix, e.g., -k, and not marked with tense or subject 
agreement morphology like a main verb could be considered deranked. 
Shagal discusses the difficulty in many languages in distinguishing between participles 
and nominalizations, and in so doing reiterates the question at the core of this chapter. Shagal 
acknowledges that there are generally two ways typologists have dealt with 
participle/nominalization polysemy, which will be familiar to the reader: one can either consider 
56 
the participle/nominalization as an argument primarily, which would make the adnominal 
modification its secondary function, or vice versa, i.e., consider adnominal modification to be the 
primary function and its use as an argument becomes secondary. If the first, then they are 
nominalizations with adnominal modification being a type of compounding; if the second, the 
verb forms are participles (Shagal 2017: 31-2). Since it has been shown that verb + -k forms are 
not nouns primarily but modifiers first, we can say they are participles by this definition. But 
before concluding, I will compare Shagal’s fuller characterization of participles to data from the 
CPK. 
Shagal determines that participles are a form of the verb, i.e., part of the verbal paradigm, 
as opposed to verbal adjectives or verbal nouns (Shagal 2017: 23). Shagal claims that they are 
inflectional rather than derivational. Shagal relies on Haspelmath (1996) who showed that 
morphology can change word class while still being inflectional rather than derivational. 
Furthermore, Shagal outlines two properties of participles that distinguish them from derivational 
verbal adjectives/nouns. First, participles are general, or in other words productive, meaning 
virtually all verbs in a language can form a participle, while verbal adjectives/nouns tend to be 
more restricted. Second, participles are regular, or transparent, meaning the meanings of the verb 
and its participle are related in a predictable and understandable way. 
In considering the generality or productivity of the -k suffix in PK, there appears to be no 
restriction on the types of verbs that can take the -k suffix. In the CPK there are 168 distinct verb 
roots that take the -k suffix. Perhaps the broadest way of categorizing verbs typologically is 
based on their syntactic argument structure, which can be summarized in terms of transitivity. 
(92a-g) show verbs of varying transitivity that have taken the -k suffix (underlined). 
 
57 
(92) a. Intransitive: 
pay-ga  randi-chi-sha   puri-k       a-shka   (CPK:est) 
3S-TOP  trade-CAUS-SS  walk-SUF  be-PERF 
‘He traveled there selling’ 
 
c. Transitive (agent subject, patient object): 
yanu-shka-ta      miku-k   shamu-i    (CPK:can) 
cook-SUF2-ACC  eat-SUF  come-IMP 
‘Come eat what has been cooked’ or ‘come as an eater of cooked things’ 
 
d. Ditransitive (agent subject, patient direct object, goal indirect object): 
chi   wañu-shka-ta  kanoa-ma   chura-k   (CPK:tip) 
that  die-SUF2-ACC  canoe-DAT  put-SUF 
‘The one who put the dead into the canoe’ 
 
e. Copula with adjective: 
kiru-ga     yana   m-a-k           a-ra    (CPK:ama) 
teeth-TOP  black  EVS-be-SUF  be-PST 
‘The teeth used to be black’ 
 
f. Copula with noun: 
pay-guna  ali      runa  sh-a-k          a-naw-ra   (CPK:pie) 
3-PL          good  man  EVO-be-SUF  be-3P-PST 
‘They used to be good men (they say)’ 
 
g. Copula with another verb + -k form: 
kani-g     sh-a-g           a-shka     (CPK:ams) 
bite-SUF  EVO-be-SUF   be-PERF 
‘He used to be a biter (they say)’ 
 
Another way of categorizing verbs is based on the semantic argument structure. 
Determining semantic structure in PK is outside the scope of this paper, but looking at verbs that 
take agent subjects (93), experiencer subjects (94), and theme/patient subjects (95) 
crosslinguistically, examples of these can be found in the CPK. 
 
58 
(93) Agent subject: 
chura-k (put-SUF) ‘one who puts’    (CPK:bec) 
hapi-k (catch-SUF) ‘one who catches’    (CPK:fin) 
piti-k (cut-SUF) ‘one who cuts’    (CPK:ser) 
ra-k (do-SUF) ‘one who does’     (CPK:def) 
shita-k (throw-SUF) ‘one who throws’   (CPK:jag) 
wañu-chi-k (kill-SUF) ‘one who kills’    (CPK:aft) 
 
(94) Experiencer subject: 
llaki-k (love-SUF) ‘one who loves’    (CPK:aft) 
manzha-k (fear-SUF) ‘one who fears’    (CPK:fin) 
macha-k (be.drunk-SUF) ‘one who drinks alcohol’  (CPK:ind) 
muna-k (want-SUF) ‘one who wants’    (CPK:ams) 
piña-k (be.angry-SUF) ‘one who is (generally) angry’ (CPK:ray) 
wiña-k (grow-SUF) ‘one who grows’    (CPK:ind) 
 
(95) Theme/patient subject: 
a-k (be-SUF) ‘one who is’     (CPK:can) 
riku-ri-k (see-PASS-SUF) ‘one who appears’ or ‘one who is seen’ (CPK:pah) 
puñu-k (sleep-SUF) ‘one who sleeps’    (CPK:rai) 
yuya-k (be.aware-SUF) ‘one who is aware’   (CPK:jag) 
urma-k (fall-SUF) ‘one who falls’    (CPK:fin) 
wañu-k  (die-SUF) ‘one who dies’    (CPK:est) 
 
A third way of categorizing verbs is based on aktionsart, or lexical aspect. Determining 
the aktionsart of PK verbs is also beyond the purview of this paper, so I will similarly look at 
verbs that fall into each category crosslinguistically. I refer to the four categories described by 
Vendler (1957): states (static), achievements (telic punctual), accomplishments (telic durative), 
and activities (atelic durative), as well as the semelfactive (atelic punctual) introduced by Comrie 
(1976). Examples of each are presented in (96). 
(96) a. State 
a-k (be-SUF) ‘one who is’     (CPK:ado) 
yacha-k (know-SUF) ‘one who knows’   (CPK:tip) 
llaki-k (love-SUF) ‘one who loves’    (CPK:the) 
shaya-ri-k (stand-PASS-SUF) ‘one who is standing’  (CPK:fin) 
59 
kawsa-k (live-SUF) ‘one who lives’    (CPK:ams) 
 
b. Achievement 
kalla-ri-k (begin-PASS-SUF) ‘one who begins’  (CPK:ray) 
hapi-k (catch-SUF) ‘one who catches’    (CPK:fin) 
pakta-k (arrive-SUF) ‘one who arrives’   (CPK:def) 
llukshi-k (emerge-SUF) ‘one who emerges’   (CPK:est) 
saki-k (leave-SUF) ‘one who leaves’    (CPK:pie) 
 
c. Accomplishment 
ra-k (make-SUF) ‘one who makes’    (CPK:def) 
chagra-k (make.chagra-SUF) ‘one who makes a chagra’ (CPK:ado) 
ñambi-k (make.path-SUF) ‘one who makes a path’  (CPK:fin) 
aswa-ta upi-k (aswa-ACC drink-SUF) ‘one who drinks aswa’ (CPK:can) 
chi-manda puri-k (there-ABL walk-SUF) ‘one who walks from there’ (CPK:fin) 
 
d. Activity 
puri-k (walk-SUF) ‘one who walks’    (CPK:est) 
kallpa-k (run-SUF) ‘one who runs’    (CPK:ado) 
rima-k (speak-SUF) ‘one who speaks’    (CPK:the) 
taraba-k (work-SUF) ‘one who works’   (CPK:aft) 
kasa-k (hunt-SUF) ‘one who hunts’    (CPK:ado) 
 
e. Semelfactive 
wakta-k (hit-SUF) ‘one who hits’    (CPK:fin) 
kani-k (bite-SUF) ‘one who bites’    (CPK:ams) 
salta-k (jump-SUF) ‘one who jumps’    (CPK:cha) 
paki-ri-k (break-PASS-SUF) ‘that which breaks’  (CPK:aft) 
tuvya-k (explode-SUF) ‘that which explodes’   (CPK:hww) 
 
Based on transitivity, semantic argument structure, and aktionsart, the -k suffix is 
seemingly unrestricted in its productivity. Considering now the regularity of the -k suffix, it has 
been shown throughout this thesis that the relationship between verb and verb + -k form is highly 
predictable. In every case, the verb + -k form refers to the one who does the verb. The only 
exception might be yacha-k (know-SUF) which means ‘shaman.’ While the meaning is clearly 
60 
related to the participial definition, i.e., ‘one who knows,’ the word yacha-k has been lexicalized 
to refer to a specific person in a community with specific characteristics and duties. This 
semantic shift, while logical, is not predictable based on the word form, and is thus less regular. 
That being said, the likelihood of yacha-k being a derivational verb + -k form as opposed to the 
more regular inflectional verb + -k forms has already been discussed in connection with Lefebvre 
& Muysken’s analysis. Incidentally, Lefebvre & Muysken assert that the derivational reading 
likely arose diachronically from a reanalysis of the inflectional readings in Cusco Quechua 
(Lefebvre & Muysken 1988: 66), and this seems the more probable path for yacha-k in PK as 
well. In terms of generality and regularity, the -k suffix seems to conform to Shagal’s 
generalization. 
Another aspect of participles described by Shagal is orientation. The orientation of a 
participle refers to the relationship between the participle and the head noun in terms of the 
underlying argument structure of the verb from which the participle came. Shagal defines 4 
orientations determined by the core arguments with which they are associated. For the following 
discussion, A refers to the subject of a transitive verb; S refers to the subject of an intransitive 
verb; and O refers to the direct object of a transitive verb. The four orientations are summarized 
in (97). 
 
(97)     a. Active participles: these are oriented toward A and S, the subjects of both transitive and 
intransitive verbs. These can also be called nominative participles. (Shagal 2017: 48) 
b. Passive participles: these are oriented toward O, the object of the transitive verb. These 
can also be called accusative participles (Shagal 2017: 52). 
c. Agentive participles: these are oriented toward only A. These can also be called 
ergative participles (Shagal 2017: 57). 
d. Absolutive participles: these are oriented toward O and S (Shagal 2017: 57). 
 
61 
To determine the orientation of verb + -k participles in PK we can look for examples of 
verb + -k forms oriented toward A, S, and O. In the CPK there are many examples of verb + -k 
forms oriented toward the subjects of transitive verbs, A, as in (98). 
 
(98) Verb + -k participles oriented toward A: 
allsa-k (pull-SUF) ‘one who pulls’    (CPK:toa) 
apa-k (take-SUF) ‘one who takes’    (CPK:sui) 
chura-k (put-SUF) ‘one who puts’    (CPK:bec) 
hapi-k (catch-SUF) ‘one who catches’    (CPK:fin) 
ni-k (say-SUF) ‘one who says’     (CPK:tip) 
piti-k (cut-SUF) ‘one who cuts’    (CPK:ser) 
ra-k (do-SUF) ‘one who does’     (CPK:def) 
shita-k (throw-SUF) ‘one who throws’   (CPK:jag) 
uya-k (hear-SUF) ‘one who hears’    (CPK:thk) 
wañu-chi-k (kill-SUF) ‘one who kills’    (CPK:aft) 
 
There are also many examples of verb + -k forms oriented toward the subjects of 
intransitive verbs, S, as in (99). 
 
(99) Verb + -k participles oriented toward S: 
kawsa-k (live-SUF) ‘one who lives’    (CPK:ams) 
macha-k (get.drunk-SUF) ‘one who drinks alcohol’  (CPK:ind) 
puñu-k (sleep-SUF) ‘one who sleeps’    (CPK:rai) 
puri-k (walk-SUF) ‘one who walks’    (CPK:ama) 
ri-k (go-SUF) ‘one who goes’     (CPK:ind) 
shaya-k (stand-SUF) ‘one who stands’   (CPK:fin) 
siri-k (lie.down-SUF) ‘one who lies down’   (CPK:ado) 
tiya-k (exist-SUF) ‘one who exists’    (CPK:tip) 
urma-k (fall-SUF) ‘one who falls’    (CPK:fin) 
wañu-k  (die-SUF) ‘one who dies’    (CPK:est) 
 
62 
There are, however, no examples of -k participles oriented toward the object of a 
transitive verb, O, in the CPK. Thus, it appears the -k suffix in PK is an active or nominative 
participle marker, being oriented toward A and S. 
 
3.3 -shka 
 
It was established in section 2.6 that the suffix -shka is potentially in a contrasting 
relationship with the -k suffix in PK and is likely of the same category. Nuckolls & Swanson 
describe verb + -shka forms as an “adjective” form of a perfective verb (Nuckolls & Swanson, 
forthcoming: 237), and throughout the literature on Quechuan languages, the equivalent suffix 
has been analyzed as either a participle (Catta Quelen 1985; Coombs 1976; Gomez Bacarreza 
1988; Debenbach-Salazar Saenz 1993; Weber 1983; Weber 1989; Parker 1969;  Samanez Flores 
1996; Huarachi Revello 2005) or as a nominalizer (Cole 1985; Soto Ruiz 1976; Lefebvre & 
Muysken 1988; Alderetes 2001; Escribens 1970). With our current understanding of the -k suffix 
as a participle, it would be fitting if -shka were shown to also be a participle. 
It has already been shown that verb + -shka forms share many of the same nominal and 
adjectival qualities as verb + -k forms. I now briefly present data from the CPK following the 
same line of reasoning taken in the discussion of -k to conclude the -shka is also a participle. 
 
(100) Noun-like function of verb + -shka  
a. with nominal plural: 
api-shka-guna       (CPK:fin) 
catch-SUF2-PL 
‘those which are caught’  
 
b. with nominal case: 
63 
yanu-shka-ta       (CPK:can) 
cook-SUF2-ACC 
‘that which is cooked’ 
 
c. modified by determiner: 
chi   tuksi-shka      (CPK:ado) 
that  puncture-SUF2 
‘that stung (thing)’ 
 
d. modified by quantifier: 
ishkay  wañu-shka      (CPK:myf) 
two      die-SUF2 
‘two that have died’ 
 
e. modified by PP: 
pay  shimi-wan    kwinta-shka  m-a-n    (CPK:tip) 
3S    mouth-INST  tell-SUF2       EVS-be-3S 
‘It is told with his mouth’ 
 
f. as subject argument: 
chi   tuksi-shka   hambi-ri-u-n     (CPK:ado) 
that  sting-SUF2  treat-PASS-DUR-3S 
‘that stung (thing) is healing’ 
 
g. as object argument: 
payna  kwinta-shka-ta  kwinta-w-ni    (CPK:man) 
3P        tell-SUF2-ACC    tell-DUR-1S 
‘I am telling what he told’ or ‘I am telling what was told by him’ 
 
(101) Modifier-like function of verb + -shka 
a. as modifier: 
pinta-shka  amarun      (CPK:Ado) 
paint-SUF2  anaconda 
‘painted anaconda’ 
 
b. as predicate modifier: 
urma-shka  m-a-ni!      (CPK:thp) 
fall-SUF2    EVS-be-1S 
‘I fell’ or ‘I am fallen’ 
 
64 
I now consider Baker & Vinokurova’s four criteria for distinguishing nominalizations 
from relatives. Their discussion focused on agentive nominalizations, and thus are not applicable 
to the current discussion conclusively, but the four criteria are concerned more with verbal 
qualities than agentive qualities; therefore, I feel comfortable presenting these data, even if the 
same conclusions derived by Baker & Vinokurova cannot be made here. It is presented more to 
highlight similarities between -shka and -k, and though it may not form the basis of my 
conclusion, it is illustrative of the more verbal nature of verb + -shka forms. 
 
(102) verb + -shka can have TAM marking: 
riksi-u-shka-guna     shamu-shka-wna-ra   (CPK:fin) 
know-DUR-SUF2-PL  come-PERF-3P-PST 
‘Those who are known had come.’ 
 
(103) verb + -shka can be negated with negative verbal morphology: 
mana  warmi   muna-w-shka     runa-shi   (CPK:ams) 
NEG    woman  want-DUR-SUF2  man-EVO 
‘A man not wanted by women’ or ‘not woman-wanted’ 
 
(104) verb + -shka can use passive morphology: 
riku-ri-shka       (CPK:thu) 
see-PASS-SUF2 
‘That which was seen’ 
 
(105) verb + -shka can be modified by adverbs: 
chasna    ra-shka  ch-a-w-n     (CPK:ama) 
like.that  do-SUF2  EVU-be-DUR-3S 
‘It is done like that, maybe’ 
 
Ultimately, the question of the -shka suffix’s category comes down to the same question 
that the discussion on -k came down to: how to reconcile the noun-like behavior and the 
modifier-like behavior. With so many similarities between the two suffixes, it is likely that not 
65 
only is the question the same, but also the solution. Consider the following example in which the 
speaker tells about her children, those that have died, and those that are still living. 
 
(106) ñuka  nueve-ta   chari-ni,  ishkay  wañu-shka,  siete   kawsa-k (CPK:myf) 
1S      nine-ACC  have-1S   two      die-SUF2        seven  live-SUF 
‘I have nine (children), two that have died, seven that live’ 
 
The parallel structure serves as fairly plain evidence that -k and -shka are likely of the 
same category. With such prevalent parallelism between -shka and -k in PK, and with the support 
of much of the literature that describes the contrasting relationship between these two suffixes, I 
conclude that -shka is likewise a participle in PK. 
To determine the -shka participle’s orientation, I searched the CPK for verb + -shka 
forms oriented toward A, S, and O. I found no instances of a verb + -shka participle oriented 
toward A. I did find, however, many examples oriented toward S, presented in (107), and 
oriented toward O, in (108). 
 
(107) Verb + -shka participles oriented toward S: 
wañu-shka (die-SUF2) ‘one that has died’   (CPK:the) 
urma-shka (fall-SUF2) ‘one that has fallen’   (CPK:thp) 
riku-ri-shka (see-PASS-SUF2) ‘that which was seen’  (CPK:thu) 
chura-ri-shka (put-PASS-SUF2) ‘one who is clothed’  (CPK:est) 
waka-shka-ta (cry-SUF2-ACC) ‘one who has cried’  (CPK:fin) 
 
(108) Verb + -shka participles oriented toward O: 
pinta-shka (paint-SUF2) ‘one that is painted’   (CPK:ado) 
muna-w-shka (want-DUR-SUF2) ‘one that is being wanted’ (CPK:ams) 
ni-shka (say-SUF2) ‘that which is said’   (CPK:fin) 
kwinta-shka (tell-SUF2) ‘that which is told’   (CPK:tip) 
yanu-shka-ta (cook-SUF2-ACC) ‘that which is cooked’ (CPK:can) 
66 
 
Being aligned toward S and O, verb + -shka forms can be considered absolutive 
participles, meaning PK has an active (or nominative) participle -k and an absolutive participle -
shka. Incidentally, one of the languages examined in Shagal (2017)’s crosslinguistic survey of 
participles was Tarma Quechua (also known as Yaru Quechua), a QI language spoken in many 
of the districts of Peru to the north east of Lima. According to Shagal’s analysis, Tarma Quechua 
has the same participial paradigm, with an active participle and an absolutive participle. 
 
3.4 Chapter summary 
 
In order to reconcile the noun-like and the modifier-like functions of verb + -k forms in 
PK, I have argued that they are participial relatives that can optionally modify a null head. I have 
shown that verb + -k forms retain a number of verbal qualities, including the ability to assign 
case, to be used with TAM morphology, to be negated with verbal negation, to inflect passive 
verb stems, and to be modified by adverbs. These suggest that verb + -k forms are not agentive 
nominalizations. They are instead “morphosyntactically deranked verb forms that can be 
employed for adnominal modification” (Shagal 2017: 1), i.e., participles. Furthermore, I have 
shown that these participles have an active (or nominative) orientation, and that they are 
contrastively paired with verb + -shka forms, which have been shown to be absolutive 
participles. 
In the final chapter of this thesis I make concluding remarks and discuss two 
shortcomings of the current study. 
  
67 
Chapter 4: Conclusion 
 
In this thesis I have presented a corpus-based description of the attributive -k suffix in PK 
using data from the CPK, concluding that the behavior and function of verb + -k forms match 
typological descriptions of active (or nominative) participles. The description was informed by 
the characterization of the -k suffix found in Nuckolls & Swanson (forthcoming), the only 
description of PK currently, as well as literature on similar suffixes in other Quechuan languages. 
The data in the CPK was found to corroborate Nuckolls & Swanson’s description of the nominal, 
adjectival, verbal, and adverbial functions of the -k suffix, as well as the non-agentive uses of the 
suffix; however, evidence was found that suggested the nominal and adjectival functions are 
actually reflexes of a single function, i.e., relative clause. 
As a first step toward reconciling the disparate functions of the suffix, I established that 
verb + -k forms in PK are first modifiers with secondary nominal functions, rather than nouns 
with secondary modifying functions. According to this analysis, verb + -k forms are relativizers, 
and when they do not modify an overt head noun, they are considered headless relatives. This 
conclusion is supported by the literature in analyses of related languages. 
Finally, I established a definition of participles based on Shagal (2017) and determined 
that verb + -k forms, as “morphosyntactically deranked verb forms that can be employed for 
adnominal modification” (Shagal 2017: 1), are participles that can serve as the head of a 
participial relative. This conclusion was bolstered by a parallel analysis to the suffix -shka which 
was shown to be contrastively related to the -k suffix and in the same category. By again 
appealing to the CPK, I was able to determine that the -k suffix exhibits behavior similar to 
68 
active participles crosslinguistically, and the -shka suffix exhibits behavior similar to absolutive 
participles. 
A relatively significant shortcoming of the current study is the size and composition of 
the corpus from which the data was gathered. The CPK is composed entirely of narratives from a 
single speaker. For a more representative analysis of PK, a larger corpus with texts from multiple 
speakers could yield more reliable and generalizable results. As it is, trusting in the competence 
of the one speaker, we can make valuable observations that are likely true of PK, though it is 
impossible to say how representative these observations are of PK as a whole. Future research 
will benefit from further documentation and digitalization of PK data. 
Another shortcoming of this thesis is the incompleteness of the analysis. The verbal and 
adverbial functions of verb + -k forms are still not well understood, although both support the 
conclusion that verb + -k forms are not nominalizations, being more verb-like. Further study is 
needed to determine exactly how the active participle -k interacts with verbs in PK when not part 
of an argument. It is my conclusion that the -k suffix in PK is an active participle, but because of 
the additional use in the habitual aspectual paradigm and its adverbial functions, perhaps a 
unique label is warranted. For this reason, I believe that the “attributive” suffix, coined by 
Nuckolls & Swanson, is an appropriate label for the suffix. My only revision to Nuckolls & 
Swanson’s original characterization would be to change the category from a deverbal 
nominalization that “attributes a certain role, ability, activity, or characteristic trait to the subject 
of its verb” (Nuckolls & Swanson, forthcoming: 174) to a deverbal participle.

Appendix 1: Complete Quechuan Family Tree 
 
Presented here is a complete family tree of languages in the Quechuan family (source: 
https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/quec1387). The languages are sorted into “branches” 
with the total number of languages in each branch given in parentheses after the branch’s name. 
For example, there are 19 languages in the Quechua I branch. PK (here Northern Pastaza 
Quichua) is in bold, as well as are all of the branches to which it belongs; thus, following the 
bold headings will lead one to PK.
